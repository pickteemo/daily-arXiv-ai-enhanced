Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain\nDamage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the\nrecent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local\nHessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite\ntheir success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal\non closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.\nWe present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of\nsecond-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves\nunder a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer\nmultilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.\nPruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\\delta W_k$,\nproducing the perturbed parameter vector $\\widehat{\\Theta}=\\Theta+\\delta\\Theta$\nand the pruned policy $\\pi(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\Theta})$.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been\nproposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods\nusually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy\nfunction, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the\npossible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible\nassignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN\nremains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features\nwith an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with\ninfinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:\n(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call\nassignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment\ngraphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that\ncan learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.\nTo evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal\nassignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space\ndimensionalities.

In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.\njoint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering\nangle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model\nwhere the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor\nattached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to\nrotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes\nmultiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as\nstability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as\nwell as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We\nuse perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under\nsymmetric periodic solution.

We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4\nMotion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the\nUS. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to\nthe US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating\nsupplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no\nmeasurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern\narchitectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The\nlimited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted\ninteractions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset\nexperiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred\nbetween datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the\nknowledge transfer between different driving cultures."}

Verifying high-level task plans before\nexecution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of\nthese systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically\nverifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or\nreal-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach\nconsists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language\ninstructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive\nanalysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the\nLLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.\nRigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad\napplicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the\nreliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for\nrobust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

However, collecting such embodied\ndata remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have\nbecome a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant\nReal2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of\nphysical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The\nproposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%\ncompared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by\n89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic\nenvironment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate\nacross real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to\nsupport fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase\nexploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of\ncontext-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous\ndriving tasks."}
