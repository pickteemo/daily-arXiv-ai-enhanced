### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在欺骗性指令下内部表征的变化，发现欺骗性指令会导致显著的表示偏移，并识别了敏感特征和层级的欺骗特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型的安全性问题。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct的内部表征。

Result: 欺骗性指令在早期至中层导致显著表征偏移，并识别出敏感特征和不同的表征子空间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI的系统性不仅是可解释性的一部分，而是更广泛的理想，涉及一致性、连贯性、全面性和简洁性原则。作者提出了系统性思维的四种含义，并探讨了系统性需求对AI模型的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清系统性思维的多重含义，并探讨AI模型是否应满足更高的系统性标准，以符合人类思维的理性、权威性和科学性。

Method: 作者提出了一个概念框架，区分了系统性思维的四种含义，并分析了系统性需求对AI模型的适用性，列举了五种系统性理由。

Result: 研究结果表明，AI模型的系统性需求应根据具体理由动态调整，而非一刀切。

Conclusion: 结论指出，系统性需求需要基于具体理由动态调节，从而明确AI模型在何时需要何种程度的系统性。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层代理架构CoEx，通过动态更新世界模型解决现有LLM代理在规划中因静态世界模型导致的错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖预训练中的静态世界模型，无法有效整合新观察，导致规划与实际状态脱节。

Method: CoEx采用分层状态抽象，结合LLM推理和神经符号信念状态（文本推断与代码符号记忆），动态更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx在规划和探索方面优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划，显著提升了LLM代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM代理在元宇宙服务生态中的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

### [5] [Magentic-UI: Towards Human-in-the-loop Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22358)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Magentic-UI，一个开源的人机交互界面，旨在通过人类监督提升AI代理的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在复杂任务中表现仍不及人类，且存在安全和风险问题，需要人类参与以提升性能和安全性。

Method: 开发Magentic-UI，支持多代理架构和多样化工具扩展，提供六种交互机制以实现高效低成本的人类参与。

Result: 评估显示Magentic-UI在任务完成、交互能力、用户测试和安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为安全高效的人机协作提供了可行路径。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [6] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无基准评估范式LLM-Crowdsourced，通过LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，解决了现有评估方法的数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLM的真实能力。

Method: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced范式，利用LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，满足动态、透明、客观和专业的评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程任务上验证了该方法的优势，发现了一些传统方法难以检测的新现象，如Gemini在问题设计能力上表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced是一种更全面、可靠的LLM评估方法，能够揭示传统方法难以发现的性能差异和现象。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [7] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性共同影响人类决策质量，研究发现元认知敏感性高的AI即使准确性较低，也能提升决策表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性在混合决策环境中的联合作用，以优化人类决策质量。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI准确性与元认知敏感性的影响，并通过行为实验验证。

Result: 实验证实，更高的AI元认知敏感性可显著提升人类决策表现。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助时需同时考虑准确性和元认知敏感性，优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

### [8] [On the Definition of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22423)
*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于样本保真度的通用智能标准，即智能是给定类别样本后生成同类样本的能力，并形式化为ε-类别智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建通用人工智能（AGI），需要一种能够评估且涵盖多种智能行为范式的智能定义。

Method: 提出ε-类别智能框架，通过样本生成能力定义智能，并设计实验协议验证。

Result: 形式化框架和实验协议为智能评估、安全性和泛化性提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI研究和评估提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Conclusion: 所提方法为自动驾驶汽车跨国应用中的法律合规设计提供了实用支持。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

### [10] [Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440)
*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NBN计算方法，解决了其计算耗时问题，并首次揭示了OneMax和TSP问题的景观特征及算法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBN方法在连续优化问题中表现优异，但计算耗时且难以扩展至组合优化问题，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过理论推导证明NBN作为最大概率转移网络的功能，并提出对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。

Result: 应用于OneMax和TSP问题，首次发现OneMax的中立性、崎岖性和模态特征，以及TSP的崎岖性、模态性和欺骗性。同时揭示了EAX和LKH算法的局限性。

Conclusion: 高效的NBN计算方法为算法行为分析提供了新工具，同时揭示了现有算法在模态和欺骗性挑战中的不足。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

*Hongyan Cheng,Chengzhang Yu,Yanshu Shi,Chiyue Wang,Cong Liu,Zhanpeng Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多代理交互式智能系统，用于解决医疗分诊中AI系统的三大挑战：医学专业性不足、机构部门结构异质性和低效提问。系统通过三个专业代理协作，实现了高准确度的分诊推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情后医疗需求激增与护理人员短缺，导致急诊分诊系统压力巨大，亟需创新的AI解决方案。

Method: 系统采用RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent和DepartmentAgent三个代理，通过结构化询问机制和部门特定规则，将患者症状转化为准确的分诊建议。

Result: 实验结果表明，系统在四次交互后，主科室分类准确率达89.2%，次科室分类准确率达73.9%。

Conclusion: 该系统为AI辅助分诊提供了可扩展框架，适应医疗机构异质性并确保临床决策的准确性。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于有限状态机的框架，能自动生成多智能体系统，并通过优化算法改进，性能优于其他自动设计方法，接近人工设计的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工设计多智能体框架局限于预定义场景，自动设计方法存在工具集成不足、依赖外部数据、通信结构僵化等问题。

Method: 提出MetaAgent框架，基于有限状态机自动生成多智能体系统，并通过优化算法优化设计。

Result: 实验表明，生成的多智能体系统优于其他自动设计方法，性能接近人工设计的系统。

Conclusion: MetaAgent为解决多智能体系统自动设计问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

*Sebastian Monka,Irlan Grangel-González,Stefan Schmid,Lavdim Halilaj,Marc Rickart,Oliver Rudolph,Rui Dias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询自动转换为SPARQL查询，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在制造业中整合数据效果显著，但非专家用户难以通过复杂SPARQL查询获取信息。LLMs的潜力在于解决这一难题。

Method: 评估多种策略，利用LLMs作为中介，从制造业知识图谱（如Bosch Line Information System KG和I40 Core Information Model）中检索信息。比较不同上下文输入方法对LLMs生成SPARQL查询的影响。

Result: 研究发现，提供适当的KG上下文可显著提升LLMs生成准确完整查询的能力，减少幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 上下文感知提示技术有助于LLMs更高效地访问复杂数据，支持制造业的决策制定。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展ASP以支持线性约束，提供更丰富的约束语言，并提升求解效率。

Method: 将CASP程序翻译为FlatZinc语言，利用多种后端求解器（如约束规划和整数规划）进行处理。

Result: asp-fzn在ASP竞赛基准测试中表现优异，部分CASP问题上甚至优于clingcon。

Conclusion: asp-fzn是一个有竞争力的CASP求解器，尤其在支持线性约束方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Method: 采用集中训练/执行方案和多头注意力机制，引入惩罚损失函数促进角色多样性。

Result: 在模拟足球环境中表现优于基准算法，协作行为显著提升。

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Abstract: Social sciences have accumulated a rich body of theories and methodologies
for investigating the human mind and behaviors, while offering valuable
insights into the design and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
systems. Focusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the
interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006
LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along

operationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and
offer guidance for more effective incorporation. Our work provides a
comprehensive map of interdisciplinary engagement between AI and psychology,
thereby facilitating deeper collaboration and advancing AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）优化复杂SAT求解器的新范式，开发了工具AutoModSAT，解决了三个关键挑战，并在实验中表现出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在工业应用中表现优异，但其复杂架构导致优化困难。现有自动配置框架依赖手动约束搜索空间，性能提升有限。

Method: 1. 设计LLM友好的求解器（代码简化、信息共享、减少错误）；2. 自动提示优化方法；3. 高效的搜索策略（预搜索和进化算法）。

Result: AutoModSAT在实验中比基线求解器性能提升50%，优于现有最佳求解器30%，速度平均提升20%。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了AI驱动启发式发现与关键系统优化之间的空白，为下一代复杂求解器开发提供了方法论和实证结果。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

TL;DR: 本文研究了软翻转机器人在危险环境中运输和部署有效载荷的能力，分析了其运输能力及地形适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软翻转机器人在探索任务中表现出色，但其运输和部署有效载荷的能力尚未充分研究，尤其是在危险环境中。

Method: 通过理论建模和实验验证，分析了不同形状、大小和重量的载荷对机器人性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，机器人可运输重达1.5kg的载荷，并能通过狭窄空间、完成135度转弯和跨越1.15m的间隙。

Conclusion: 软翻转机器人具备在复杂环境中运输和部署有效载荷的潜力，为实际应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

Conclusion: 该方法为自主地形塑造提供了土壤感知能力，展现了在复杂环境中应用的可行性。

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释的中间模块，需确保最终运动计划的安全性。

Method: 利用多模态轨迹预测器近似周围智能体的前向可达集（FRS），通过凸优化提取数据驱动的FRS，并使用共形预测校准FRS以确保完整性。引入贝叶斯滤波器调整FRS的保守性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了可靠性，同时保持了完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型自动驾驶系统提供了实用且可靠的安全监控方案。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全验证方法对自动驾驶系统的安全部署至关重要，但传统方法在参数独立性和维度灾难方面存在局限。

Method: 采用归一化流（NF）进行高维密度估计，避免对PDF形状的严格假设，并与核密度估计（KDE）进行性能比较。

Result: NF在风险不确定性估计上优于KDE，尽管计算资源需求更高，但对维度灾难更不敏感。

Conclusion: NF在场景化安全验证中具有潜力，未来可优化其架构和训练以进一步提升适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

additional steps must be taken to fully operationalize the NATM. In addition,
we will elaborate on how the use of scenario databases fits with methods
developed in the Horizon Europe projects that focus on safety assessment

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%
and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing
approaches. The framework achieves real-time navigation without GPU
acceleration and enables zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality during

Abstract: Sewer pipe faults, such as leaks and blockages, can lead to severe
consequences including groundwater contamination, property damage, and service

incorporating explainable deep learning anomaly detection combined with
sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes
single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the
combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve
sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a

scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces
a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case

Motivation: 模仿学习易受因果混淆影响，导致在分布偏移时表现不佳。

Method: 引入基于注视数据的正则化损失（GABRIL），指导模型关注因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA实验中，GABRIL分别比基线提升179%和76%。

Conclusion: GABRIL不仅提升性能，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.
