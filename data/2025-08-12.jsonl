This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.\n  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model\nto predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair\nvalue of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies\nby simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel\nusing GPU acceleration.\n  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms\nwhere the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as\nturn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets."}

Their evaluation across diverse tasks has\nconsistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive\nand personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone\nto errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They\nstruggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases\ndue to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,\ntheir reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,\nleading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore\nthe limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework\nbased on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive\nbehaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49\ndistinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and\nhateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,\na QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and\noutperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where\nOpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This\nresearch also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently\nunderperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and\nrepresentative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and\nexplainability."}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced\nPOI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over\nmultiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs.

They provide both structural and functional information about the\nrelationships that are present in the system. The structural information\noutlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional\ninformation describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned\nmodels. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while\naccounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more\nrobust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using\nsignificantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common\nmodel-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage\nthe sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating\na causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that\ninform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder\nprobabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics\nof a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform\nnew tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new\nrequirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile\nrobots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the\nlearned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and\nchanges in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world\nrobotics scenarios.

However, existing decision-making\nalgorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social\nacceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging\ndecision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human\ndrivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road\nvehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT\nproblem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving\npreferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing\nefficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style\nestimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by\nobserving the immediate reactions of MVs.

Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing\ndatasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered\nin the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,\nnegatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.\n  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to\ngeneralize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,\ndespite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose\nGrasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to\ninfer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical\ncharacteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object\ntypes compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.\n  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp\nNetwork (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp\nestimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively\nexpanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)\nenables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic\nprojection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object\ntypes.
