This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,\ntransforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes\nwithin sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile\nsensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials\nor designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material\nfabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric\nmodel to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately\npredict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the\nfingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,\ndemonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile\nfeedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading\nconditions.

Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations.

We measured gait performance and perceived\nbody images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each\ntraining session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot\nsystems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking\nwith a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more\ncertain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor\nlearning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,\nindicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into\ntheir sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.\nHowever, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,\nlikely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis\nfrom wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training\nsessions might limit further motor improvement.

The following article has been accepted by\n  Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science", "summary": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be\nutilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical\nreservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such\nphysical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to\ncompute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own\nbehavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and\nembed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called\na tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the\nenvironment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different\nattractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis\nreveals that there exist \"untrained attractors\" in the state space of the\nsystem outside the training data.

In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological\nexplorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments.

The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites.

Success in these tasks requires\neffective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as\nthe ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and\ndemonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,\nhighlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in\nsimulation.

However, the design of\nsuch systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the\naffordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like\nfarmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization\nmethodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.\nThis framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment\nrepresentations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)\noptimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our\nframework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using\ntwo off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce\nnovel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize\nmanipulator redundancy comprehensively.

Furthermore,\nrecognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we\npropose methods for searching for these separate SMM components.

Traditional methods, such as simple moving\naverages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine\nlearning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer\npotential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training\ninefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,\ninspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to\ntheir adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making\nthem suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge.

This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty\nbehaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors\nto unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such\nquestions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,\nconsisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by\nmulti-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked\nthe honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our\nfindings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when\nnecessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but\nis deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of\ndedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment.

Bayesian statistics offers a principled\nprobabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as\nprobability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The\ncore computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including\nperception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can\nbe effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite\nthe deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied\nintelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in\ntoday's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian\nand contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental\nlenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as\nhighlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay \"The Bitter Lesson\". This\nanalysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in\nthe development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals\nthat current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to\nclosed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian\nmethods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open\nphysical-world embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5f53\u4ee3\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c01\u95ed\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a\ngiven Markov decision process (MDP).

Among binary causal methods, most methods based\non additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal\nmodel.

Therefore, on observation\ndata, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference\nmodel (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality.

This streamlines the\noptimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost\nperformance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using\nSDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while\napplying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the\ntime-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and\nallowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.\nAdditionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in\noptimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling.

In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model\nreflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the\nfine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the\nEDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{D}riven Advantage\nand \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the\nproblem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

To bridge this gap, the 2025 Interspeech Speech Accessibility\nProject (SAP) Challenge was launched, utilizing over 400 hours of SAP data\ncollected and transcribed from more than 500 individuals with diverse speech\ndisabilities. Hosted on EvalAI and leveraging the remote evaluation pipeline,\nthe SAP Challenge evaluates submissions based on Word Error Rate and Semantic\nScore. Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2\nbaseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.\nNotably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\\%, and the highest\nSemScore of 88.44\\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR\nsystems in recognizing impaired speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025 Interspeech SAP Challenge\u5229\u7528400\u5c0f\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u6539\u8fdbASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6b8b\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c12/22\u56e2\u961f\u5728WER\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c17/23\u56e2\u961f\u5728SemScore\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6b8b\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528400\u5c0f\u65f6SAP\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7EvalAI\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWER\u548cSemScore\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "12\u56e2\u961fWER\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c17\u56e2\u961fSemScore\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u56e2\u961fWER 8.11%\uff0cSemScore 88.44%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP Challenge\u4e3a\u6b8b\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
