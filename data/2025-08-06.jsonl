This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

Existing defenses often rely on shallow\npattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack\nstrategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense\n(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by\napplying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful\nintent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning\nchain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a\nlocalized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised\nfine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason\nabout known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,\nan entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to\nencourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments\ndemonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and\nexhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks."}

However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently\nambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system\nbehaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data\ndependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and\nhandle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code\ngeneration framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal\nspecifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating\ndecision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural\nrelationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously\neliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and\ndependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load\nassociated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy\nand efficiency."}

To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG\ninvolves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which \"hides\" by generating subtle,\ndeceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which \"seeks\" to accurately detect\nthem. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic\nprecision are enhanced.

To fill this\ngap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which\ncombines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic\nrouting solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.\nSpecifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path\ncost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each\nencompassing varying degrees of model adjustments.

This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories.

The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable.

Such representations tend to\nobscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with\ninternal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory\nepistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures.

This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution.
