However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in\nboth indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and\napplicability.

Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

By embedding physical laws\nand constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing\nan accurate and robust navigation solution.

We present ASI-Arch,\nthe first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research\n(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully\nautonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to\nconduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring\nhuman-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization\nto automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in\nthe domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel\narchitectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and\nempirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and\npast experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000\nGPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed\nunexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered\narchitectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically\nsurpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for\narchitectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling\nlaw for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural\nbreakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress\nfrom a human-limited to a computation-scalable process.

The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D\nreconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing\neach scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local\ntangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk\naligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth\ninterpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D\nellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this\nrepresentation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian\ndisks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance\nprior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we\npropose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal\nconsistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both\nvisual and geometric fidelity.

The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository.

However, this single-point preview tracking strategy\nfails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control\nactions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its\ncontrol performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.\nTraditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between\ncapturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often\nresulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.\nThis method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a\nLinear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input\nbased on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC\ncalculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by\nadding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and\ninterpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance\noptimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the\nCarsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH\nracing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the\ntraining data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)\nwhile delivering superior tracking performance.

Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance.

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B.
