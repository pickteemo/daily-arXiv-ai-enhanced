### [1] [Research on UAV Applications in Public Administration: Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14096)
*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出改进的dRRT算法，通过四种策略优化无人机路径规划，在仿真环境中相比传统算法表现更优，成功率达100%，运行时间仅0.01468秒，路径更短更平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机从'技术工具'向'治理基础设施'转型，低空经济政策和智慧城市需求推动下，高效的路径规划对公共管理应用变得至关重要，需要解决能耗、避障和空域限制等挑战。

Method: 提出增强型快速探索随机树算法(dRRT)，包含四种策略：目标偏向加速收敛、动态步长平衡探索与避障、绕行优先选择水平绕行而非垂直爬升、B样条平滑提升路径平滑度。在500立方米城市环境进行随机建筑仿真测试。

Result: dRRT相比传统RRT、A*和蚁群算法表现更优：100%成功率，平均运行时间0.01468秒，路径长度更短，航点更少，轨迹更平滑（最大偏航角<45度）。

Conclusion: dRRT在公共管理场景如应急响应和交通监控中具有高效部署潜力，但存在计算开销增加和目标偏向可能导致局部最优的局限性，需要与实时避障框架集成。该研究推动了城市治理、机器人和计算优化的跨学科发展。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

### [2] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)
*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的人形机器人SE(2)目标位姿到达方法，通过星座式奖励函数优化短距离运动的能量效率和时间效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法主要优化速度跟踪而非直接位姿到达，导致短距离任务中出现低效的踏步式行为，需要开发更实用的人形机器人短距离运动方法

Method: 开发了基于强化学习的方法，采用新的星座式奖励函数来鼓励自然高效的目标导向运动，并建立了包含能耗、到达时间和步数指标的基准测试框架

Result: 该方法在SE(2)目标分布上 consistently优于标准方法，成功实现了从仿真到硬件的迁移，证明了针对性奖励设计的重要性

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励设计对于实用短距离人形机器人运动至关重要，该方法在能量消耗、时间效率和运动自然性方面都表现出优越性能

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

### [3] [Task and Motion Planning for Humanoid Loco-manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14099)
*Michal Ciebielski,Victor Dhédin,Majid Khadiv*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于优化的任务与运动规划框架，通过共享接触模式表示统一处理移动和操作规划，实现符号动作与接触模式变化关联，支持包含全身动力学和约束的统一搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以统一处理人形机器人的移动和操作任务，需要开发能够整合任务规划、接触规划和运动规划的统一框架，同时考虑全身动力学和各种约束条件。

Method: 定义符号动作为接触模式变化，将高层规划与底层运动关联，建立统一的搜索框架，整合任务规划、接触规划和运动规划，包含全身动力学、机器人、操作对象和环境之间的所有约束。

Result: 在人形机器人平台上验证，能够生成广泛的物理一致移动操作行为，处理需要复杂推理的长动作序列。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够解决集成TAMP公式的工作，实现了完全无环规划和包含驱动约束的全身动力学，为人形机器人移动操作问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

### [4] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)的领域转换框架，解决软机器人动力学建模中跨领域知识迁移的挑战，特别是在材料特性变化(如粘度增加10倍)的情况下实现控制器的有效迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软机器人材料会随时间逐渐退化，传统分析方法需要精确的物理特性知识，而深度学习模型在一个领域学习的映射无法直接迁移到具有不同物理特性的其他领域。

Method: 使用条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)框架，通过动态学习方法将标准仿真环境中训练的姿态控制器适配到粘度增加10倍的目标领域，模型学习基于末端执行器位置和方向的输入压力信号。

Result: 在五种不同形状的轨迹跟踪实验中验证了方法的有效性，并在噪声扰动和周期性测试中展现了良好的鲁棒性，CCGAN-GP成功实现了跨领域技能迁移。

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP框架为软机器人控制器提供了更好的适应性和泛化能力，为解决软机器人材料退化带来的控制挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

### [5] [Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105)
*Jahid Chowdhury Choton,John Woods,William Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个高效可定制的多机器人导航环境，在连续状态动作空间中解决不确定环境下的路径规划问题，使用多种RL方法进行测试并验证了实际应用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在连续状态动作空间和不确定环境中的导航与路径规划是一个开放挑战，现有深度强化学习方法存在样本效率低、训练时间长且缺乏形式化保证的问题。

Method: 将多机器人导航任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，设计优化问题并关联到寻找MDP的最优策略。创建了多个环境变体，使用A2C、PPO、TRPO、TQC、CrossQ和ARS等梯度与非梯度RL方法进行性能评估。

Result: 在CoppeliaSim机器人模拟器中部署到3D农业田间环境进行实际应用验证，通过对学习模型进行推理测试来测量鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究人员提供了开发适用于现实世界系统的MDP环境的方法指导，并展示了如何在有限资源和合理时间内使用现有最先进RL方法解决多机器人导航问题。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

### [6] [SimGenHOI: Physically Realistic Whole-Body Humanoid-Object Interaction via Generative Modeling and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14120)
*Yuhang Lin,Yijia Xie,Jiahong Xie,Yuehao Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Jiajun Lv,Yukai Ma,Xingxing Zuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimGenHOI是一个结合生成建模和强化学习的统一框架，用于生成可控且物理合理的人形机器人-物体交互动作，解决了现有方法中不合理的接触、穿透和全身动作等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人形机器人-物体交互生成方法（如基于扩散的模型）经常出现不合理的接触、穿透和不真实的全身动作等伪影，阻碍了在物理环境中的成功执行。

Method: 基于扩散变换器（DiT）的生成模型预测关键动作，结合接触感知的全身控制策略进行强化学习训练，采用相互微调策略迭代优化生成模型和控制策略。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了生成建模和强化学习的优势，为人形机器人-物体交互生成提供了物理真实且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

### [7] [Lightweight Tracking Control for Computationally Constrained Aerial Systems with the Newton-Raphson Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14185)
*Evanns Morales-Cuadrado,Luke Baird,Yorai Wardi,Samuel Coogan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的轻量级跟踪控制器，在微型飞艇和中型四旋翼无人机上进行实验验证，相比传统控制方法在计算时间和能耗方面有显著优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究轻量级跟踪控制器在真实飞行环境中的性能，特别是在计算资源受限的机载系统上的适用性

Method: 使用基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的跟踪控制器，与反馈线性化（飞艇）和非线性模型预测控制（四旋翼和飞艇）进行对比实验

Result: 牛顿-拉弗森流控制器在跟踪性能上与基准方法相当或更优，同时计算时间和CPU能耗大幅降低

Conclusion: 该轻量级控制器在保证跟踪性能的同时显著降低了计算开销，适合在资源受限的空中机器人平台上部署

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

### [8] [SLAM-based Safe Indoor Exploration Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14235)
*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对有障碍物的平面空间的2D探索策略，使用双轮差速驱动系统，通过安全骨架方法进行探索，优先考虑避障安全性和未探测空间的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究针对具有圆形足迹且不能即时控制姿态的传统代理，在充满障碍物的平面空间中实现安全有效的探索，而不是使用能够即时调整位置和高度的点机器人。

Method: 采用自平衡双轮差速驱动系统，配备线性加速度计、角速度陀螺仪、3D-LiDAR和前置RGB-D相机。使用IMU和LiDAR进行RTAB-SLAM，相机用于闭环检测。探索策略采用安全骨架方法，使代理尽可能远离静态障碍物，朝向空间中的开口方向前进。

Result: 通过ROS移动代理进行了实验研究，展示了在探索空间时的路径规划策略。

Conclusion: 该空间探索策略以代理的避障安全为最高优先级，其次是未探测空间的探索，为传统移动代理在复杂环境中的自主探索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

*Daegyun Choi,Alhim Vera,Donghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究从蜥蜴等动物的空中翻正反射中获取灵感，通过计算机视觉提取运动轨迹，并应用于空间机械臂系统的控制优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决空间机械臂系统在微重力环境下的控制难题，特别是机械臂与航天器基座之间的动态耦合问题

Method: 使用高速视频记录和计算机视觉技术提取动物空中翻正运动轨迹，通过多目标优化框架分析行为目标，并将结果作为参考轨迹应用于空间机械臂控制

Result: 成功将动物进化行为转化为可解释的自适应控制策略，为空间机器人提供了改进机动性和鲁棒性的方法

Conclusion: 生物启发方法为空间机器人控制提供了有效途径，未来任务中的机动性和鲁棒性有望得到显著提升

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

### [10] [D$^2$-LIO: Enhanced Optimization for LiDAR-IMU Odometry Considering Directional Degeneracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14355)
*Guodong Yao,Hao Wang,Qing Chang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强型激光雷达-惯性里程计框架，通过自适应异常值容忍对应和扫描到子图配准策略，解决了LiDAR特征退化问题，提高了在复杂环境中的定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-惯性里程计在复杂环境中对精确定位和建图至关重要，但LiDAR特征退化问题严重影响了状态估计的可靠性，需要开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应异常值去除阈值（根据点传感器距离和平台运动幅度动态调整），结合灵活的扫描到子图配准方法，利用IMU数据优化位姿估计，并设计了融合IMU预积分协方差和退化度量的新型权重矩阵。

Result: 在室内外稀疏或退化特征环境中的大量实验表明，该方法在鲁棒性和准确性方面 consistently优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的增强型LIO框架通过自适应异常值处理和扫描到子图配准策略，有效解决了LiDAR特征退化问题，显著提高了在复杂环境中的定位性能和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨LLM智能体在多智能体救援任务中的协作能力，通过系统评估其在分工、优先级排序和合作规划方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在沟通、规划和推理方面展现出强大能力，但需要验证其在需要物理基础协作的多智能体环境中是否也能有效支持合作。

Method: 使用LLM智能体在完全已知的图基环境中执行结构化受害者救援任务，评估其在资源分配、分工合作和紧急优先级处理方面的表现。

Result: 通过协调敏感性指标（任务成功率、冗余行动、房间冲突和紧急加权效率）系统评估LLM智能体的协作性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在物理基础多智能体协作任务中的优势和失败模式，为未来基准测试和架构改进提供了新见解。

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Motivation: 在机器人控制和资源分配等应用中，确保安全行为需要学习带有动作约束的策略。当模仿者动作空间小于专家时，会导致占用度量不匹配的问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出DTWIL方法，将轨迹对齐重新表述为规划问题，使用模型预测控制（MPC）和动态时间规整（DTW）距离来生成遵循类似状态轨迹但符合动作约束的替代数据集。

Conclusion: DTWIL通过有效的轨迹对齐方法成功解决了动作约束模仿学习中的占用度量不匹配问题，为安全机器人控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/NYCU-RL-Bandits-Lab/ACRL-Baselines.

*Nicole Fronda,Phil Smith,Bardh Hoxha,Yash Pant,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan是一个用于城市空中交通(UAM)的公平协商式飞行规划器，通过运营商和服务提供商协作计算公平的飞行路径，在路径长度公平性和轻微延迟之间取得平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前飞行规划器可能导致某些无人机获得不成比例的短路径，而牺牲其他无人机的利益，需要一种公平的方式来优化飞行路径长度

Method: 三步法：1)服务提供商基于垂直起降场容量约束起降选择；2)运营商在约束下独立规划；3)服务提供商解决路径冲突，优化路径长度公平性

Result: 仿真实验显示比非公平规划器产生更公平的结果，以轻微延迟为代价

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan通过公平分摊冲突解决成本，鼓励更广泛参与UAM，确保空域安全，并提升运营商灵活性

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当机器人存在竞争利益时，需要优化资源使用的公平性，特别是能量消耗的公平分配，同时保持任务成功

Method: 制定分布式公平运动规划器，并与安全控制器集成，形成FiReFly算法

Result: FiReFly产生更公平的轨迹，提高任务成功率，实时性能可达15个无人机，扩展到50个无人机需要在运行时间和公平性改进之间权衡

Conclusion: 在多机器人系统中引入公平性概念是可行的，FiReFly算法能有效实现公平的能量消耗分配，同时保持任务性能

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

*Haitong Ma,Bo Dai,Zhaolin Ren,Yebin Wang,Na Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出通过预训练学习动态表示来提升有限专家数据下的离线模仿学习性能，理论证明最优决策变量位于表示空间中，可显著减少下游IL参数学习量，实验显示仅需单条轨迹即可模仿专家策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限数据已成为扩展离线模仿学习的主要瓶颈，需要解决专家数据稀缺的问题

Method: 引入预训练阶段学习动态表示（来自转移动态的分解），使用噪声对比估计的损失函数，可从任意同动态数据中学习表示

Result: MuJoCo实验显示仅需单条轨迹即可模仿专家策略，真实四足机器人实验表明可利用模拟器预训练表示从少量真实演示中学习行走

Conclusion: 动态表示预训练能有效缓解离线模仿学习中的数据限制问题，实现从模拟到现实的迁移学习

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

TL;DR: DEXTER-LLM是一个用于未知环境中动态任务规划的新框架，结合了LLM的开放世界推理能力和基于模型的优化方法，解决了在线适应性和可解释性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的场景推理和规划方法主要针对已知环境的一次性端到端解决方案，缺乏在线操作的动态适应能力和规划过程的可解释性

Method: 集成四个模块：任务理解模块、基于LLM的在线子任务生成器、最优子任务分配器和调度器、动态适应和人机验证模块

Result: 实验评估显示100%成功率，平均完成160个任务和480个子任务（基线3倍），适应过程中LLM查询减少62%，复合任务规划质量提高2倍

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了LLM的开放世界推理能力和基于模型的分配方法的最优性，同时解决了在线适应性和可解释性的关键问题

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FBI是一个视觉触觉模仿学习框架，通过运动动力学动态融合触觉交互和视觉观察，解决了灵巧手内操作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧手内操作由于复杂的接触动力学和部分可观测性一直是机器人学的挑战。人类能够协同使用视觉和触觉完成此类任务，而机器人方法往往只优先考虑一种模态，限制了适应性。

Method: FBI通过动态感知潜在模型建立触觉信号与物体运动之间的因果关系，使用基于transformer的交互模块将基于流的触觉特征与视觉输入融合，训练一步扩散策略进行实时执行。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在两个定制的手内操作任务和三个标准灵巧操作任务上，在仿真和真实世界中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FBI框架通过动态融合视觉和触觉信息，有效提升了机器人灵巧操作的性能，证明了多模态融合在复杂操作任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Abstract: This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service
Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a
series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and
reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a
pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container
with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

Abstract: To address the challenges of localization drift and perception-planning
coupling in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in open-top scenarios
(e.g., collapsed buildings, roofless mazes), this paper proposes EAROL, a novel
framework with a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR configuration (20{\deg}
inclination), integrating a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) system and a
hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization algorithm. The hardware innovation
enables constraint enhancement via dense ground point cloud acquisition and
forward environmental awareness for dynamic obstacle detection. A
tightly-coupled LIO system, empowered by an Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(IESKF) with dynamic motion compensation, achieves high level 6-DoF
localization accuracy in feature-sparse environments. The planner, augmented by
environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision,
and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error
reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift
across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a
hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主飞行器运动规划框架在复杂动态环境中面临局部最小值和死锁挑战，导致碰撞风险增加，需要更鲁棒的时空避障解决方案。

Method: 提出分层规划框架：前端使用动态增强可见概率路线图(DEV-PRM)快速探索拓扑路径；后端采用统一无终端最小控制多项式(UTF-MINCO)和动态距离场(DDF)实现预测性避障；引入增量多分支轨迹管理框架进行时空拓扑决策。

Conclusion: TRUST-Planner通过拓扑引导的分层规划有效解决了自主飞行器在动态环境中的规划挑战，具有高成功率和实时计算性能，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial
vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and
deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical
information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that
TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Motivation: 移动机器人在环境监测等任务中需要高效跟踪动态目标，但漂浮目标受环境干扰（风、水流）而漂移，涉及时空变化的预测，这是一个具有挑战性的问题

Method: 提出信息路径规划框架，包含时空预测网络来预测目标位置分布随时间变化，以及自适应规划目标用于目标跟踪

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效映射动态环境中任意数量初始位置未知的移动目标，在动态环境监测应用中具有实用价值

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩展卡尔曼滤波器在陆地车辆定位中存在一致性问题，需要增强其长期精度和稳定性。

Method: 使用流形误差状态扩展卡尔曼滤波(M-ESEKF)，在降维空间中表示位姿，并引入新颖的校正方案嵌入领域知识到传感器数据中。

Result: 广泛的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，M-ESEKF在一致性和稳定性方面优于经典滤波器，且无需场景特定的参数调优。

Conclusion: M-ESEKF提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在各种实际场景中实现更准确和一致的车辆定位。

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在情感评分任务中与人类高度相似，但在唤醒度评分上差异较大，幸福度评分最一致。LLM评分比人类更同质化，在五类情感框架中比二维情感维度表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型如何评估情感刺激，为LLM在日常生活中的应用提供参考，评估模型在情感认知方面与人类行为的对齐程度。

Method: 使用人类先前评定的情感词汇和图像数据集，让多个流行LLM进行相同评分任务，比较GPT-4o等模型与人类参与者的评分一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在大多数评分维度上与人类高度相关（r≥0.9），但唤醒度评分一致性较差，幸福度评分最一致。LLM在五类情感框架中比二维情感维度表现更好，且评分比人类更同质化。

Conclusion: LLM在情感刺激解释方面显示出与人类智能的相似性和差异，为LLM在情感相关角色中的有效性提供了重要见解，但需要注意评分同质化和特定情感维度差异的问题。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要主动感知、协作推理和视角感知（理解其他智能体能看到或知道什么）的任务中仍面临挑战，研究旨在通过结构化示例提升LLM智能体的视角感知能力。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，使用Fast Downward规划器生成三种类型的示例：最优目标路径(G型)、信息节点路径(E型)和对比替代行动的逐步最优决策序列(L型)，并通过LLM将这些解决方案转换为"思考-行动"示例。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

TL;DR: H-J是一个分层多智能体框架，通过知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化来解决城市洪水应急调度中的多目标权衡、动态环境适应和LLM策略稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端城市降雨事件频发导致交通拥堵和服务中断，现有方法在感知、全局优化和多智能体协调方面存在不足，需要动态、上下文感知的决策策略。

Method: 提出H-J分层多智能体框架，整合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到策略执行的闭环管道。

Result: 在真实城市拓扑和降雨数据上的实验表明，H-J在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性方面优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性感知和知识约束的LLM方法有望增强城市洪水响应的韧性。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个专门评估LLM通过MCP服务器交互处理真实复杂任务的综合基准，涵盖6个核心领域11个服务器，发现即使是SOTA模型也存在显著性能限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用挑战，如长程推理和大规模陌生工具空间，需要专门针对MCP协议的真实评估基准

Method: 构建包含6个领域11个MCP服务器的综合基准，实现执行式评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器、动态评估器），自动检索实时真实数据

Result: 顶级模型表现有限（GPT-5:43.72%, Grok-4:33.33%, Claude-4.0-Sonnet:29.44%），面临长上下文和未知工具挑战，企业级代理性能不优于标准ReAct框架

Conclusion: MCP-Universe填补了关键评估空白，开源的可扩展框架支持新代理和服务器集成，推动MCP生态系统创新

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

TL;DR: 通过数据驱动的主动学习方法，基于PAC学习理论，估计计算机物理系统在有限时间窗口内的安全概率，并提供统计信心


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机物理系统(CPS)的复杂性使得手动提取模型困难，需要数据驱动方法来解决验证、诊断等任务

Method: 将CPS抽象为Mealy机，采用基于PAC学习理论的主动学习方法，通过指导性采样获取学习数据

Result: 在自动车道保持系统案例中验证了该方法，能够估计系统在有限时间窗口内的安全概率

Conclusion: 该方法为CPS的概率性安全性分析提供了数据驱动的解决方案，并通过概率约简正确学习理论提供了信心保障

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨AI模型是否能内省，提出了比现有"轻量级"定义更"厚重"的内省定义，并通过实验证明LLMs虽然看似具备轻量级内省能力，但无法达到作者提出的更严格的内省标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型是否能内省是一个重要的实践问题，但缺乏对"内省"的统一定义。作者旨在提出一个更严格、更有意义的内省定义。

Method: 作者提出了一个新的内省定义：任何能通过比第三方可用方法更可靠且计算成本相当或更低的过程来获取内部状态信息的过程。通过让LLMs推理其内部温度参数的实验来验证。

Result: 实验显示，虽然LLMs表面上表现出轻量级内省能力，但无法满足作者提出的更严格的内省定义标准。

Conclusion: 需要采用更严格的内省定义来准确评估AI模型的内省能力，当前LLMs的内省能力有限，无法达到有意义的自省水平。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.
