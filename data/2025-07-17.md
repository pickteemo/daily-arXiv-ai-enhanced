*Hengyue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 探讨AI能否推动人类与自然从支配关系转向共生，并通过案例研究展示AI在生态设计中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI如何作为媒介，改变人类与自然的互动模式，实现真正的生态共生。

Method: 通过案例研究分析AI在数据、图像识别和生态修复中的应用，并结合强化学习与植物修复技术提出设计路径。

Result: AI不仅扩展了创意方法，还重构了生态设计的理论与实践，展示了其在科学、艺术和环保中的潜力。

Conclusion: AI为可持续技术生态系统提供了研究路线图，未来可进一步探索其在生态设计中的角色。

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on
sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.

### [2] [General Modular Harness for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Gaming Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11633)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过模块化设计提升通用代理在多轮游戏环境中的性能，利用游戏作为多样化测试平台。

Conclusion: 模块化设计有效推进通用代理的发展，游戏作为测试平台具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of
perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM
backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

### [3] [Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662)
*Moises Andrade,Joonhyuk Cha,Brandon Ho,Vriksha Srihari,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器在复杂任务中表现出‘同意偏见’，即倾向于支持上下文中的信息。提出的自接地验证（SGV）方法显著提升了验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）中，如何扩展验证器的能力是一个挑战。MLLMs因其世界知识和对人类偏好的对齐成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出自接地验证（SGV），通过无条件生成和条件生成两步法，利用MLLMs自身的采样机制优化验证过程。

Result: SGV使MLLM验证器的准确率和故障检测率提升高达20点，并在多个任务中实现实时监督，性能超越之前最佳方法48%。

Conclusion: SGV有效解决了MLLMs的同意偏见问题，显著提升了其在复杂任务中的验证能力。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

### [5] [Auto-Formulating Dynamic Programming Problems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11737)
*Chenyu Zhou,Jingyuan Yang,Linwei Xin,Yitian Chen,Ziyan He,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DP-Bench基准和DPLM模型，用于自动化动态规划问题建模，通过DualReflect数据生成方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划建模依赖专家知识，大语言模型（LLMs）虽具潜力，但面临数据稀缺和随机性挑战，需专门解决方案。

Method: 引入DP-Bench基准和7B参数的DPLM模型，采用DualReflect合成数据生成方法（结合前向和后向生成）。

Result: DPLM性能媲美主流LLMs，在难题上表现更优；DualReflect在低数据和高数据场景下各有优势。

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向数据生成方法可互补优势，为动态规划自动化建模提供有效路径。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Conclusion: 通过结合CPU和GPU的并行能力，论文提出的方法显著提升了DFS的效率，为GPU在搜索算法中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

### [8] [Aime: Towards Fully-Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11988)
*Yexuan Shi,Mingyu Wang,Yunxiang Cao,Hongjie Lai,Junjian Lan,Xin Han,Yu Wang,Jie Geng,Zhenan Li,Zihao Xia,Xiang Chen,Chen Li,Jian Xu,Wenbo Duan,Yuanshuo Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aime是一个新型多智能体框架，通过动态反应式规划和执行解决传统静态框架的局限性，显著提升多智能体系统的适应性和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统的规划和执行框架存在刚性执行、静态能力和低效通信等问题，限制了其在动态环境中的表现。

Method: Aime采用动态规划器、动态角色工厂和集中式进度管理模块，实现实时策略调整、按需角色创建和全局状态感知。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如GAIA、SWE-bench Verified和WebVoyager）中，Aime表现优于现有最先进的专用智能体。

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更灵活、高效和鲁棒的基础框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

### [9] [Understanding visual attention beehind bee-inspired UAV navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11992)
*Pranav Rajbhandari,Abhi Veda,Matthew Garratt,Mandayam Srinivasan,Sridhar Ravi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于光学流的强化学习代理在无人机导航中的应用，发现代理主要关注光学流的不连续区域和大流量区域，行为类似昆虫飞行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统（如蜜蜂）在有限感官和计算能力下仍能飞行和避障，启发研究者探索基于光学流的无人机导航策略。

Method: 使用强化学习训练代理，仅依赖光学流输入在隧道中导航，并分析其注意力模式。

Result: 代理主要关注光学流的不连续区域和大流量区域，行为类似昆虫，且策略在不同代理间一致。

Conclusion: 这种策略可能适用于开发简单的无人机显式控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

### [10] [Topology Enhanced MARL for Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making of CAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12110)
*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于拓扑增强的多智能体强化学习（TPE-MARL）方法，用于优化混合交通中联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的协同决策。通过构建游戏拓扑张量和结合QMIX算法，TPE-MARL有效平衡了探索与利用，提升了交通效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在联合状态-动作空间的指数增长下，探索与利用的权衡问题尤为突出。本文旨在通过拓扑增强方法优化CAVs在混合交通中的决策。

Method: 1. 构建动态交通流的游戏拓扑张量，压缩高维状态信息；2. 基于QMIX算法，结合访问计数和智能体互信息，建立拓扑增强的MARL框架。

Result: TPE-MARL在多种交通密度和CAV渗透率下表现出色，平衡了探索与利用，显著提升了交通效率、安全性和决策平滑性，且决策合理性优于或接近人类驾驶员。

Conclusion: TPE-MARL通过拓扑增强方法有效解决了MARL中的探索与利用问题，为混合交通中的CAV协同决策提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is
available at

### [11] [Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming: Solving POMDPs Sans Numerical Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12186)
*Edward Kim,Hanna Kurniawati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线近似POMDP求解器，通过深度采样未来历史并逐步更新策略，性能损失由采样误差的平均值而非最大值决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线规划中采样稀疏性问题，提升动态环境下的决策性能。

Method: 提出Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming，结合深度采样和逐步策略更新。

Result: 理论证明性能损失受采样误差平均值限制，实验验证在动态环境中优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该求解器在复杂动态环境中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics
often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with
generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces
BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics.
Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance
heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building
characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome
Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic.

### [13] [Xiangqi-R1: Enhancing Spatial Strategic Reasoning in LLMs for Chinese Chess via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12215)
*Yuhao Chen,Shuochen Liu,Yuanjie Lyu,Chao Zhang,Jiayao Shi,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在空间战略推理（如中国象棋）中的不足，并提出了一种针对中国象棋的训练框架Xiangqi-R1，显著提升了模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的重要基准，但LLMs在空间战略推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。中国象棋因其复杂规则和空间复杂性成为理想测试平台。

Method: 提出Xiangqi-R1模型，分三阶段训练：1）微调以预测合法移动；2）加入战略标注；3）通过GRPO强化学习提升推理稳定性。

Result: Xiangqi-R1比通用LLMs在合法移动预测和分析准确率上分别提升18%和22%。

Conclusion: 该研究为在空间复杂领域开发通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层协作的匝道合并控制框架（HCOMC），用于解决混合交通流中的匝道合并问题，结合纵向跟车模型和横向换道模型，并通过仿真验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路匝道合并区域是交通拥堵和事故的常见瓶颈，而基于联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）的协作控制策略是解决这一问题的根本方法。但由于CAV尚未普及，需要提出适用于混合交通流的解决方案。

Method: 扩展了基于智能驾驶员模型的纵向跟车模型和基于五次多项式曲线的横向换道模型，提出了HCOMC框架，包括分层协作规划模型、基于博弈论的可选换道模型和多目标优化模型。

Result: 仿真结果表明，HCOMC在提高车辆群安全性、稳定和加速合并过程、优化交通效率和节省燃油消耗方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HCOMC为混合交通流中的匝道合并问题提供了有效的解决方案，尤其在CAV普及率较低的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

*Yifan Xu,Qianwei Wang,Jordan Lillie,Vineet Kamat,Carol Menassa,Clive D'Souza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CoNav Chair智能轮椅，结合共享控制导航和障碍物避障功能，旨在提高导航效率、安全性和易用性。初步评估显示共享控制模式优于手动和全自动模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着残疾人群体的增长，现有电动轮椅的灵活性不足，难以在空间受限环境中导航。完全自主或手动控制模式可能影响效率和用户信任。

Method: 基于ROS设计CoNav Chair，比较手动、共享和全自动三种导航模式，通过21名健康参与者进行室内环境测试。

Result: 共享控制模式碰撞更少，任务完成时间、轨迹长度和平滑度表现优异，用户主观评价更高。

Conclusion: CoNav系统展示了良好的安全性和性能，为后续残疾用户测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,
so will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and
social integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both
indoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is
based on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,
offering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in
spatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs
has focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;
approaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these
challenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on
the Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and
obstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational
efficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav
Chair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three
distinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,
conducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor
building environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control
navigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed
comparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task
completion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being
safer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of
usability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and
performance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end
users, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.

Conclusion: 该方法通过标准化和语义整合，显著提升了机器人对环境数据的理解和决策能力，为认知控制提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In robotics, the effective integration of environmental data into actionable
knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the variety and
incompatibility of data formats commonly used in scene descriptions, such as
MJCF, URDF, and SDF. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses these
challenges by developing a unified scene graph model that standardizes these
varied formats into the Universal Scene Description (USD) format. This
standardization facilitates the integration of these scene graphs with robot
ontologies through semantic reporting, enabling the translation of complex
environmental data into actionable knowledge essential for cognitive robotic
control. We evaluated our approach by converting procedural 3D environments
into USD format, which is then annotated semantically and translated into a
knowledge graph to effectively answer competency questions, demonstrating its
utility for real-time robotic decision-making. Additionally, we developed a
web-based visualization tool to support the semantic mapping process, providing
users with an intuitive interface to manage the 3D environment.

of the existing data collection paradigm and learning framework, three key
challenges restricting the development of dexterous robotic manipulation are
summarized and discussed.

Conclusion: 结合AD技术与AR需求，旨在加速安全、高效、可扩展的AR系统开发。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于凸剖分拓扑的算法CDT-TCS，用于解决系绳机器人在受限环境中的路径规划问题，并衍生出三种应用算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系绳机器人在特殊环境（如灾害响应和地下探索）中具有稳定供电和可靠通信的优势，但其运动规划受限于系绳长度和缠绕风险。

Method: 利用CDT编码作为同伦不变量表示路径拓扑状态，结合代数拓扑和几何优化，通过单次计算得到2D环境中所有位置的最优可行配置。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，所提算法在各自问题领域显著优于现有方法，并验证了其工程实用性。

Conclusion: CDT-TCS及其衍生算法为系绳机器人的路径规划提供了高效解决方案，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.

Conclusion: NemeSys为动态不确定水下环境中的目标驱动自适应AUV平台提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Adaptive mission control and dynamic parameter reconfiguration are essential
for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied,
communication-limited marine environments. However, most current AUV platforms
execute static, pre-programmed missions or rely on tethered connections and
high-latency acoustic channels for mid-mission updates, significantly limiting
their adaptability and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce NemeSys, a
novel AUV system designed to support real-time mission reconfiguration through
compact optical and magnetoelectric (OME) signaling facilitated by floating
buoys. We present the full system design, control architecture, and a semantic
mission encoding framework that enables interactive exploration and task
adaptation via low-bandwidth communication. The proposed system is validated
through analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and
open-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation
and semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for
goal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.

Motivation: 解决密集动态环境中实时路径规划的挑战，尤其是预测大量动态障碍物未来运动的计算负担和不现实性。

Method: 提出HyPRAP框架，结合多种预测模型，使用P-CRI评估障碍物风险，并通过混合共形预测量化不确定性。

Result: 理论分析和仿真表明，HyPRAP优于单一预测方法，P-CRI比基于邻近性的风险评估更有效。

Conclusion: HyPRAP在密集动态环境中实现了安全性与计算效率的平衡，适用于大规模障碍物场景。

Abstract: Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a
challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic
obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we
introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a
prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid
combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel
Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过相似性匹配和局部优化，有效解决了单视角抓取中的不确定性，为未知物体抓取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

TL;DR: 提出了一种交互感知的神经网络增强MPPI控制方法（IANN-MPPI），用于自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的轨迹规划，解决了传统方法过于保守的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测与规划方法忽略了周围车辆对自动驾驶车辆行为的交互反应，导致规划过于保守且目标未达成。

Method: 结合交互感知神经网络和MPPI控制，预测周围车辆对每个控制序列的反应，并引入样条先验优化车道变换行为。

Result: 在密集交通合并场景中，IANN-MPPI能够高效完成合并操作。

Conclusion: IANN-MPPI通过交互感知和优化采样分布，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的规划能力。

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is
challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning
objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate
and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional
decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions
that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural
Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which
enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents
may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in
structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI
sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate
IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to
perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at

comprehensive synthesis of GAI applications in aquaculture, encompassing
foundational architectures (e.g., diffusion models, transformers, and retrieval
augmented generation), experimental systems, pilot deployments, and real-world
use cases. We highlight GAI's growing role in enabling underwater perception,
digital twin modeling, and autonomous planning for remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) missions. We also provide an updated application taxonomy that spans
sensing, control, optimization, communication, and regulatory compliance.
Beyond technical capabilities, we analyze key limitations, including limited
data availability, real-time performance constraints, trust and explainability,
environmental costs, and regulatory uncertainty. This review positions GAI not
merely as a tool but as a critical enabler of smart, resilient, and
environmentally aligned aquaculture systems.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Conclusion: 鲁棒路径规划方法优于传统最短路径，尤其适用于较宽、较慢且导航行为保守的机器人。

Abstract: Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight
distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid

ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

Motivation: 果园中GPS信号不可靠且标准SLAM方法因树木外观重复易出错，需开发专门方法以实现精准单棵树定位。

Method: 使用RGB-D图像和实例分割模型检测树干，通过级联图数据关联算法重识别树干，结合GPS、里程计和树干观测构建因子图框架。

Result: 系统在苹果和梨园数据集上验证，定位误差低至18厘米，低于种植距离的20%。

Conclusion: Tree-SLAM在GPS信号不可靠时仍能实现高精度和鲁棒性的单棵树地图构建。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision
agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like
targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps
is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree
canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can
confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce
Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual
trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with
an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them
using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified
trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS
signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of
individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less
than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on
diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,
demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable
GPS signals.

Abstract: Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development, while
collecting detailed data on its related features remains challenging due to the
high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery
robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution
to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile
data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to
walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped
robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101
trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of
features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,
duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk
utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications
were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that
pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk
characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity
associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed
closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for
assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous
monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the
development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.

Abstract: As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in
safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse
conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety
verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling
and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which
exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's
operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data
collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic
transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that
encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety
properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are
verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,
provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with
regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of
autonomous systems.

Abstract: Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的LiDAR全局定位（LGL）方法UniLGL，通过编码完整点云信息并设计多BEV融合网络，实现空间、材料和传感器类型的统一性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LGL方法通常仅考虑部分信息或针对单一传感器，忽略了统一性。UniLGL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将点云编码为空间和强度BEV图像，设计多BEV融合网络，引入视角不变性假设。

Result: 实验证明UniLGL在真实环境中表现优异，适用于多种平台和场景。

Conclusion: UniLGL在统一性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，适用于工业和野外场景。

Abstract: Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,
geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous
LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL
method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and
material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the
proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both
geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial
BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network
is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and
material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a
viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional
translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and
supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors
and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local
features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose
estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on
SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness
of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world
environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively
competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL
has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping
as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,
demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly being tested into public spaces to enhance
user experiences, particularly in cultural and educational settings. This paper
presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum
guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive
capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions,
allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs
robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling
seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user
requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34
participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and
quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that
the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum
experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This
study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the
potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge
acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such
technologies in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path
planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in
such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on
generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating
simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs
across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate
success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text
prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on
larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models
generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not
universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,
and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These
results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint
adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future
LLM development in robotic path planning.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效加速复杂重抓取问题的求解，提升规划效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider manipulation problems in constrained and cluttered settings,
which require several regrasps at unknown locations. We propose to inform an
optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP) solver with possible regrasp
areas and grasp sequences to speed up the search. Our main idea is to use a
state space abstraction, a regrasp map, capturing the combinations of available
grasps in different parts of the configuration space, and allowing us to
provide the solver with guesses for the mode switches and additional
constraints for the object placements. By interleaving the creation of regrasp
maps, their adaptation based on failed refinements, and solving TAMP
(sub)problems, we are able to provide a robust search method for challenging
regrasp manipulation problems.

industrial standards such as NEC 70, NFPA 79, and UL 508A; (2) a software
control system based on a Raspberry Pi and Python, featuring fault detection,
GPIO logic, and operator interfaces; and (3) a mechanical system that includes
a 3-axis Cartesian robot, pneumatic actuation, and a precision liquid dispenser
enclosed within a safety-certified frame. The ACAT enables high-throughput,
automated surface characterization and provides a robust platform for future
integration into smart manufacturing and materials discovery workflows. This
paper details the design methodology, implementation strategies, and system
