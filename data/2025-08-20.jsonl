However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the\nresulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs).

Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts.

A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to\nnavigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,\ncorridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and\nhumans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc\nrepresentation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting\nto start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own\ntaxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research\nmoving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a\nwell-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly."}

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC\nachieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the\nbest-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent\ncomplementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities."}

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one.
