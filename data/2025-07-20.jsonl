This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science.

Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for\nhallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose\nDEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex\noptimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding\nrepresentations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from\ninverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task\ndemonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures\ntarget and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that\nhardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance\nof the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering\nexpertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced\nmultitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of\nhallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm\ntasked with tabletop manipulation."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.

Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these\nskills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two\nsimultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another\nbetween the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a\ncrucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool\nmanipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world\ndata and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot\ntool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework\ninvolves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in\ntool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations\ncollected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate\nthat this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with\ndiverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations\non the Franka Emika robot arm.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.
