Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of\nhigh-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings\noffer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and\noperations across the joint force."}

In this paper, we present the mapping\nof an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at\nGinnie Springs, FL.

This paper introduces the\nEpisodic RRT, a novel hybrid planning framework that replaces the primitive of\na random point with a learned, multi-step \"exploratory episode\" generated by a\nDeep Reinforcement Learning agent. By making the DRL agent the engine of\nexploration, ERRT transforms the search process from a diffuse, volumetric\nexpansion into a directed, branch-like growth. This paradigm shift yields key\nadvantages: it counters the curse of dimensionality with focused exploration,\nminimizes expensive collision checks by proactively proposing locally valid\npaths, and improves connectivity by generating inherently connected path\nsegments. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation across 2D, 3D,\nand 6D environments that ERRT and its variants consistently and significantly\noutperform their classical counterparts. In a challenging 6D robotic arm\nscenario, ERRT achieves a 98% success rate compared to 19% for RRT, is up to\n107x faster, reduces collision checks by over 99.6%, and finds initial paths\nthat are nearly 50% shorter.

In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized\ngeneral safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety\nby incorporating a personalization parameter, $\\rho$, into the safety\nmeasurement framework to account for individual differences in safety\nperception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a\nsimulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot\nbehavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\\rho$ effectively\ncaptures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,\ntrust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.\nSpecifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot\nbehavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly\nenhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of\nuser types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.\nNotably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated\nexposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,\nemphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change.
