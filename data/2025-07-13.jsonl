Existing solutions predominantly rely on\nrigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable\ngarments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior\nrobotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control\nstrategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and\nadaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the\nSelf-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth\nmechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing.

We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency.

This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and\nthe influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is\nfrequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments\nof intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing\nbiases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach\nleveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.\nApplied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,\nlimitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings\nsuggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the\ntransparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall\nvalidation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work\nadopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for\nrefinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the\npotential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for\nmore reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks."}

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive."}

Despite notable\nsuccesses, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and\nethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by\nbiological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input\n(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive\nsensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively\nmodulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal\nconfigurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts\nand improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates\nthat adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass\nsubstantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more\ndata and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive\nsensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous\nsystems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess\ntechnical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted\nresearch directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive\nalgorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.\nCollectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward\nsustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems."}
