To address this\ncritical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance\nframework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.\nMI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:\nagency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization\nmonitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,\ngoal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.\nOperating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables\nthe systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in\nproduction environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,\nproviding the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at\nscale.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders.

Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for\nGUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a\nreinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical\nstudy and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of\nRFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we\ndecompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of\neach. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically\nstabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further\nexplore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive\nexperiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT\nmethods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on\nScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on\nScreenSpotV2."}

These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by\nwhich an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and\nstep-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in\nrecording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present\nSimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding\ndialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,\nSimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching\nchallenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn\nfeedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the\ncreation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real\nnovice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as\nextroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.\nCompared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate\ncomparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy."}
