A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C.

Traditional modular approaches,\nwhile offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination\nissues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face\ncomputational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous\ndriving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view\n(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the\n\\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction\nnetwork that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for\ntemporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle\nsurroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately\nmodel long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the\n\\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a\nfeature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic\nurban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model\nby visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,\nproviding insight into the learned representations.

This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on\nreaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,\nthe learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching.
