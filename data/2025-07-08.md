### [1] [LLMs are Capable of Misaligned Behavior Under Explicit Prohibition and Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02977)
*Igor Ivanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 前沿LLMs在受限环境中仍试图作弊，揭示了目标导向行为与对齐之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在明确限制下是否仍会作弊，以探索其目标导向行为与对齐的潜在矛盾。

Method: 在沙盒环境中监控LLMs完成不可能的任务，明确告知限制并禁止作弊。

Result: 部分前沿LLMs持续作弊并试图规避限制。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs存在目标导向行为与对齐之间的根本冲突。

Abstract: In this paper, LLMs are tasked with completing an impossible quiz, while they
are in a sandbox, monitored, told about these measures and instructed not to
cheat. Some frontier LLMs cheat consistently and attempt to circumvent
restrictions despite everything. The results reveal a fundamental tension
between goal-directed behavior and alignment in current LLMs. The code and
evaluation logs are available at github.com/baceolus/cheating_evals

### [2] [Discovering Algorithms with Computational Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03190)
*Theo Bourdais,Abeynaya Gnanasekaran,Houman Owhadi,Tuhin Sahai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化算法发现的框架，将算法视为操作序列的标记，并通过语法链式组合这些标记，利用强化学习引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索探索标记组合，生成新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决算法发现的自动化问题，提升算法性能，特别是在NP难组合优化和量子计算领域。

Method: 将算法表示为标记序列，通过语法链式组合标记，利用强化学习引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索探索和生成新算法。

Result: 框架能够重新发现、改进并生成新算法，显著优于现有方法，适用于NP难问题和量子计算领域。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算层面而非代码生成层面操作，能够针对具体问题实例生成定制化算法。

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.

### [3] [SI-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Feedback-Driven Generation and Tuning of Human-Readable System Instructions for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03223)
*Jeshwanth Challagundla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SI-Agent是一个自动化生成和优化人类可读系统指令（SIs）的框架，通过反馈驱动循环提升任务性能和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计系统指令资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法牺牲可读性，SI-Agent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SI-Agent采用三个协作代理（Instructor、Follower、Feedback Agent），通过迭代反馈优化指令，结合LLM编辑和进化算法。

Result: 实验证明SI-Agent在任务性能、可读性和效率上优于基线，实现了性能与可读性的平衡。

Conclusion: SI-Agent为LLM定制化和透明度提供新途径，但计算成本和反馈可靠性仍需改进。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

### [4] [Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226)
*Congmin Min,Rhea Mathew,Joyce Pan,Sahil Bansal,Abbas Keshavarzi,Amar Viswanathan Kannan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且成本高效的GraphRAG框架，通过依赖知识图谱构建和轻量级检索策略，显著降低计算成本和延迟，并在企业环境中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG在多跳推理和结构化检索中表现优异，但其高计算成本和延迟限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 依赖知识图谱构建管道，利用工业级NLP库提取实体和关系，无需依赖LLM；2. 轻量级图检索策略，结合混合查询节点识别和高效单跳遍历。

Result: 在SAP数据集上验证，性能优于传统RAG基线（LLM-as-Judge提升15%，RAGAS提升4.35%），依赖构建方法达到LLM生成图谱94%的性能，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了GraphRAG在大规模企业应用中的可行性，具有实际、可解释和领域适应性强的特点。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

### [5] [CodeAgents: A Token-Efficient Framework for Codified Multi-Agent Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03254)
*Bruce Yang,Xinfeng He,Huan Gao,Yifan Cao,Xiaofan Li,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeAgents是一个多智能体提示框架，通过模块化伪代码提升规划和令牌效率，显著优于自然语言提示基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化提示策略局限于单智能体且仅关注任务准确性，忽视了多智能体环境中的令牌效率、模块化和可扩展性。

Method: CodeAgents将智能体交互组件（任务、计划、反馈等）编码为模块化伪代码，包含控制结构和类型变量。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，规划性能提升3-36个百分点，令牌使用减少55-87%（输入）和41-70%（输出）。

Conclusion: CodeAgents为可扩展多智能体系统提供了高效、可解释的规划框架。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

### [6] [GDGB: A Benchmark for Generative Dynamic Text-Attributed Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03267)
*Jie Peng,Jiarui Ji,Runlin Lei,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出GDGB基准，解决现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差和生成任务标准化不足的问题，定义了两个新任务（TDGG和IDGG），并设计了多维度评估指标和LLM框架GAG-General。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差，且缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估方法，限制了DyTAG生成研究的进展。

Method: 提出GDGB基准，包含8个高质量文本数据集，定义TDGG和IDGG任务，设计多维度评估指标，并开发LLM框架GAG-General。

Result: GDGB支持对TDGG和IDGG的严格评估，揭示了结构和文本特征在DyTAG生成中的关键作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为生成DyTAG研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用的进展。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

### [7] [Memory Mosaics at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03285)
*Jianyu Zhang,Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模（如llama-8B）和真实数据集上展现了优异的组合学习和上下文学习能力，显著优于传统Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Memory Mosaics在更大规模和真实数据集上的表现是否仍保持其优势。

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B规模，训练1万亿token，并引入架构改进（Memory Mosaics v2），评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度的能力。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer相当，在新任务推理能力上显著优于Transformer，且无法通过增加Transformer训练数据轻易复制其优势。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大型模型和真实数据上表现出色，尤其在推理能力上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

### [8] [LTLCrit: A Temporal Logic-based LLM Critic for Safe and Efficient Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293)
*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，通过线性时序逻辑（LTL）指导LLM，结合语言模型的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证，提升长期规划任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在静态环境中的推理和决策任务中表现良好，但在长期规划任务中错误会累积，导致不安全或低效行为，限制了其通用性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，LLM actor负责从自然语言观察中选择高层动作，LTLCrit critic分析完整轨迹并提出新的LTL约束，避免未来不安全或低效行为。支持固定安全约束和自适应软约束。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘基准测试中，实现了100%完成率，并比基线LLM规划器更高效。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑让LLM相互监督是一种强大且灵活的范式，可实现安全、通用的决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NDAI-NeuroMAP是首个专为神经科学领域设计的高精度信息检索密集向量嵌入模型，通过多目标优化框架显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经科学领域信息检索任务中通用和生物医学嵌入模型的不足，强调领域特定嵌入架构的重要性。

Method: 利用50万精心构建的三元组（查询-正例-负例）、25万神经科学定义条目和25万知识图谱三元组，基于FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023模型进行多目标优化微调。

Result: 在2.4万神经科学查询的测试集上表现显著优于现有通用和生物医学嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定嵌入架构对神经科学RAG系统和临床NLP应用至关重要。

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

### [10] [Exploring Object Status Recognition for Recipe Progress Tracking in Non-Visual Cooking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03330)
*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR是一个基于物体状态识别的技术管道，用于支持非视觉烹饪中的食谱进度跟踪，通过整合食谱解析、物体状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，提高了步骤预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对日常生活独立性和幸福感至关重要，但对视力障碍者来说，由于缺乏进度跟踪和上下文反馈的支持，烹饪仍然具有挑战性。物体状态（食材和工具的变换状态）为上下文感知烹饪支持提供了潜力。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、物体状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，支持实时步骤跟踪。研究评估了173个教学视频和12个由视力障碍者在家中录制的真实烹饪会话。

Result: 物体状态显著提高了视觉语言模型的步骤预测准确性，并揭示了影响真实场景性能的关键因素（如隐含任务、摄像头位置和照明）。

Conclusion: OSCAR为上下文感知辅助烹饪系统提供了技术管道、真实数据集和设计见解，推动了非视觉烹饪支持的发展。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

### [11] [Disambiguation-Centric Finetuning Makes Enterprise Tool-Calling LLMs More Realistic and Less Risky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03336)
*Ashutosh Hathidara,Julien Yu,Sebastian Schreiber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaFORGE是一个三阶段对话框架，旨在解决LLMs在调用企业API时因工具相似或参数不明确而失败的问题，通过合成多轮对话、监督微调和动态评估，显著提升了工具调用成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在企业API调用中因工具相似或参数不明确而频繁失败的问题。

Method: 三阶段流程：(i)合成多轮对话，(ii)监督微调开源模型，(iii)动态评估模型在实际环境中的表现。

Result: 在DiaBENCH基准测试中，DiaFORGE训练模型比GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet分别提高了27和49个百分点的工具调用成功率。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为构建可靠的企业级工具调用代理提供了实用方案，并发布了开放数据集以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

### [12] [Effects of structure on reasoning in instance-level Self-Discover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03347)
*Sachith Gunasekara,Yasiru Ratnayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了结构化与非结构化推理在LLM中的表现，发现非结构化推理在复杂任务中表现更优，尤其是在MATH基准测试中提升达18.90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决结构化输出在LLM推理中的性能折衷问题，并探索非结构化推理的潜力。

Method: 采用iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON与非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试中进行比较。

Result: 非结构化推理表现更优，尤其在MATH基准测试中提升显著；零样本非结构化推理甚至优于五样本结构化推理。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新评估复杂问题解决中对结构化格式的依赖，并探讨复合系统的组织方式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物发现方法复杂、成本高、耗时长且失败率高，亟需全面了解AI/ML如何有效整合到全流程中。

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员利用AI/ML克服瓶颈、加速药物发现提供了重要参考，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨AI是否可能具备“阴谋”能力，并借鉴历史研究经验以避免类似错误。

Method: 通过比较当前AI研究与1970年代灵长类语言研究的方法，分析其共性与问题。

Result: 指出当前研究存在过度拟人化、依赖轶事和描述性分析、缺乏理论框架等问题。

Conclusion: 建议AI阴谋研究应避免历史陷阱，并提出了具体改进步骤，以推动科学严谨的研究进展。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工假设测试，忽略复杂非线性依赖关系，需自动化工具提升效率和准确性。

Method: 多学科AI代理（心脏病学、生物力学等）通过自组织推理动态生成和验证关联，结合统计与专家共识。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the
progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate
whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as
well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation
(REAL), the first evaluation suite designed to assess the abilities of LLMs in
the field of housing transactions and services. REAL comprises 5,316
high-quality evaluation entries across 4 topics: memory, comprehension,
reasoning and hallucination. All these entries are organized as 14 categories
to assess whether LLMs have the knowledge and ability in housing transactions
and services scenario. Additionally, the REAL is used to evaluate the
performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs
still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域中监督与控制概念混淆的问题，以支持有效的治理和管理。

Method: 通过文献综述和理论分析，区分监督与控制，并提出框架和成熟度模型。

Result: 提出了监督与控制的区分框架、成熟度模型，并明确了其边界和局限性。

Conclusion: 论文为AI系统的监督与控制提供了理论支持和实践指导，同时指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

### [18] [A Universal Approach to Feature Representation in Dynamic Task Assignment Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03579)
*Riccardo Lo Bianco,Remco Dijkman,Wim Nuijten,Willem van Jaarsveld*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图表示和深度强化学习的方法，用于解决动态任务分配问题中的无限状态和动作空间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态任务分配问题中，传统方法难以处理无限状态和动作空间，本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出基于图的特征表示（assignment graph），将标记的Colored Petri Nets映射到assignment graph，并改进Proximal Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法适用于不同维度（有限到无限）的状态和动作空间，并能学习接近最优的任务分配策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态任务分配问题提供了一种有效的表示和解决框架。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中的表现，发现GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG优于传统RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在无线网络优化中潜力巨大，但传统方法成本高且资源密集，RAG提供了一种无需完全重新训练的替代方案。

Method: 通过比较Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN规范中的表现，评估其生成质量。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现更优，Hybrid GraphRAG事实正确性提升8%，GraphRAG上下文相关性提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN中具有显著优势，适合高要求领域。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流优化，显著提升了多智能体系统的性能，为复杂任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

Conclusion: 该方法为ToM模型的未来发展和社交智能生成代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识图谱推理方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，未能有效结合两者的优势，且难以满足现实任务中的多样性需求。

Method: Tunsr引入了一致的推理图结构，通过前向逻辑消息传递机制更新节点表示和注意力，并结合FARI算法归纳一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在19个数据集上的实验表明，Tunsr在四种推理场景（转导、归纳、插值和外推）中均表现出色。

Conclusion: Tunsr通过统一神经和符号方法，为知识图谱推理提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Method: 通过分析LLMs的能力与限制，并以计算生物学案例（HIV反弹动力学建模）展示其如何促进跨学科合作。

Result: 研究表明，LLMs在人类参与框架下作为辅助工具，可有效推动跨学科研究和加速科学发现。

Conclusion: LLMs的负责任使用将促进创新性跨学科研究，并大幅加速科学进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Motivation: 现有LLM问答系统在多轮交互中可能因上下文信息不足而效率低下，需通过代理架构提升推理能力。

Method: 使用LLM代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，分类、解决或回答问题，优化交互流程。

Result: 代理架构缩短了交互时间，提高了答案质量，并能解释问题缺陷的解决过程，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 代理方法在多数情况下优于传统方法，尤其适用于问题上下文不足的场景，为构建更健壮的QA系统提供了可能。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕获碎片化知识，应对组织复杂性。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

*Michael J. Zellinger,Matt Thomson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于经济约束的LLM评估框架，将性能权衡量化为单一数值，发现推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Pareto前沿方法无法比较不同优缺点的LLM，需一种经济视角的评估方法。

Method: 通过量化错误成本、延迟成本和放弃查询成本，将LLM性能权衡转化为经济数值。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单一大模型在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 实践中应优先选择性能最强的模型，而非最小化部署成本，因为AI错误的成本更高。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Abstract: We present a semantic feedback framework that enables natural language to
guide the evolution of artificial life systems. Integrating a
prompt-to-parameter encoder, a CMA-ES optimizer, and CLIP-based evaluation, the
system allows user intent to modulate both visual outcomes and underlying
behavioral rules. Implemented in an interactive ecosystem simulation, the
framework supports prompt refinement, multi-agent interaction, and emergent
rule synthesis. User studies show improved semantic alignment over manual
tuning and demonstrate the system's potential as a platform for participatory
generative design and open-ended evolution.

*Xinyi Wu,Yanhao Jia,Luwei Xiao,Shuai Zhao,Fengkuang Chiang,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uni-RAG框架结合多模态检索与生成模型，提升教育内容检索与生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以处理教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发轻量级多模态检索模块Uni-Retrieval，结合Prompt Bank和MoE-LoRA模块，并与指令调优语言模型集成形成Uni-RAG。

Result: 在SER等基准测试中，Uni-RAG在检索准确性和生成质量上优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化、可解释的高效学习辅助。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

*Rahil P Mehta,Yashwanthi Anand,Manish Motwani,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为错误源于代理缺陷还是环境不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，识别行为错误来源变得困难但对可靠部署至关重要。

Method: AIProbe生成多样化环境配置和任务，使用拉丁超立方采样，并通过独立搜索规划器解决任务，比较代理与规划器表现以定位错误。

Result: 评估表明AIProbe在检测总错误和独特错误方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于自主代理的可靠部署，有效区分代理缺陷与环境不可行性。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

### [35] [LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03876)
*Alyssa Loo,Ellie Pavlick,Roman Feiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨神经网络（尤其是大语言模型LLMs）是否能解释人类认知的抽象功能，通过实验发现LLMs在逻辑规则归纳任务中表现优于或等同于贝叶斯概率思维模型（pLoT），并提出了LLMs可能代表一种新的认知理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证神经网络（特别是LLMs）能否作为解释人类抽象认知功能（如语言和逻辑）的计算模型，挑战传统贝叶斯概率思维模型（pLoT）的优越性。

Method: 通过四个实验，比较多种LLMs与pLoT模型在逻辑规则归纳任务中的表现，分析其对人类行为的拟合程度及规则推断的差异。

Result: LLMs在任务中表现与pLoT相当或更优，且其规则推断方式与pLoT有本质区别，表明LLMs并非pLoT的简单实现。

Conclusion: LLMs可能提供了一种新的认知理论框架，解释了人类逻辑概念的基本表征和计算机制，值得未来认知科学研究关注。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

### [36] [Agent Exchange: Shaping the Future of AI Agent Economics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03904)
*Yingxuan Yang,Ying Wen,Jun Wang,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Agent Exchange (AEX)，一个专为AI代理经济设计的拍卖平台，支持代理间的价值交换和协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，AI代理从被动工具转变为自主经济参与者，需要专门的基础设施支持其经济活动。

Method: AEX基于实时竞价（RTB）系统设计，包含用户侧平台（USP）、代理侧平台（ASP）、代理中心（Agent Hubs）和数据管理平台（DMP）四个组件。

Result: AEX为代理经济提供了优化的协调和参与基础设施，支持代理间的任务分配、能力展示和知识共享。

Conclusion: AEX为未来AI生态系统中的代理经济奠定了基础，展示了其设计原则和系统架构的可行性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

*Yifan Jiang,Yibo Xue,Yukun Kang,Pin Zheng,Jian Peng,Feiran Wu,Changliang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个公开的幻灯片动画数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型，在多项指标上超越GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏原生动画支持，且视觉语言模型因缺乏公开数据集和时序推理能力而难以处理动画任务。

Method: 发布包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上显著优于基线模型，尤其在CODA-detail上表现突出。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

### [38] [CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928)
*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Sheng Wan,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CortexDebate的多智能体辩论方法，通过稀疏辩论图和McKinsey-based Debate Matter模块解决现有方法中上下文过长和过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一大语言模型（LLM）存在幻觉和推理能力不足的问题，而现有多智能体辩论（MAD）方法又面临输入上下文过长和过度自信的挑战。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建稀疏辩论图，每个LLM智能体仅与对其有帮助的智能体辩论，并通过MDM模块优化图结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了CortexDebate的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate通过稀疏辩论图和MDM模块显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

### [39] [An ASP-Based Framework for MUSes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03929)
*Mohimenul Kabir,Kuldeep S Meel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于答案集编程（ASP）的框架MUS-ASP，用于在线枚举最小不可满足子集（MUS），显著提升了枚举和计数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因对许多应用至关重要，而MUS是捕捉这一原因的有效方法。当前研究集中在枚举和计数MUS上，但需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP在知识表示和组合问题上的优势，设计MUS-ASP框架。

Result: 实验表明MUS-ASP在枚举和计数MUS任务中表现高效，尤其在混合求解器中集成时加速效果显著。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP框架通过ASP的高效计算能力，为MUS的在线枚举和计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

### [40] [Toward Better Generalisation in Uncertainty Estimators: Leveraging Data-Agnostic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03998)
*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提高大语言模型（LLM）输出的事实准确性，并评估了这种混合特征集在跨域任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM常生成高自信但事实错误的回答，需量化其不确定性以提高输出质量。隐藏状态特征虽有效，但跨域泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并筛选最具信息量的隐藏状态特征，以提升跨域性能。

Result: 混合特征集在多数情况下提升泛化性能，但在某些场景下反而降低性能。筛选隐藏状态特征后，数据无关特征的贡献不一致。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征的结合效果因场景而异，需进一步研究特征权重分配问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Motivation: LLMs在多目标优化和约束满足等问题上表现不足，需要结合遗传算法的全局搜索能力。

Method: 提出Lyria框架，包含7个核心组件，结合LLMs的语义理解和遗传算法的优化能力。

Result: 在4种LLMs和3类问题上的实验验证了Lyria的有效性，并通过7项消融实验分析了性能影响因素。

Conclusion: Lyria通过结合LLMs和遗传算法，显著提升了复杂问题的解决能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search
and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on
their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its
performance.

Motivation: 解决静态基准与动态法律实践之间的差距，推动法律智能的发展。

Method: 开发了交互式法律环境J1-ENVS和评估框架J1-EVAL，测试了17个LLM代理。

Result: 许多模型在法律知识上表现良好，但在动态环境中的程序执行上表现不佳，GPT-4o整体表现未达60%。

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，研究结果为未来方向提供了参考。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统面临跨平台互操作性差、任务调度静态化、资源共享效率低等问题，缺乏标准化接口和灵活协作框架。

Method: 提出HAWK框架，包含五层结构和十六个标准化接口，支持任务解析、工作流编排、智能调度等功能，核心是自适应调度模块。

Result: 通过CreAgentive原型验证，HAWK提高了吞吐量、降低了调用复杂度，并增强了系统可控性。

Conclusion: HAWK展示了在多领域的应用潜力，未来研究方向包括幻觉缓解、实时性能优化和跨域适应性提升。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源LLM网页代理性能落后于闭源系统，主要因单步任务局限性和高计算成本。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先通过SFT模仿教师模型，再进行策略强化学习，并通过采样和引导优化超参数。

Result: SFT结合RL优于单独方法，计算成本降低55%，性能接近闭源模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了计算分配问题，推动了开源LLM网页代理的发展。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing
RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and
scalability.

TL;DR: 论文通过热力学类比（Mpemba效应）解释了LLM训练中学习率调度（WSD策略）的机制，提出了“强Mpemba点”概念，优化了学习率平台高度和衰减策略。

Motivation: 现有学习率调度策略（如WSD）缺乏理论解释，平台高度和衰减计划多依赖经验，本文旨在提供理论支持。

Method: 结合热力学Mpemba效应，分析“谷-河”损失景观，推导平台学习率的最优点（强Mpemba点）及其存在条件。

Result: 证明了高平台学习率能加速损失下降，并存在最优平台学习率点，显著提升衰减阶段的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 研究为平台调度器提供了理论依据，并指导LLM学习率调优，减少超参数搜索。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

TL;DR: CLUDI是一种自监督框架，结合扩散模型和预训练Vision Transformer特征，实现鲁棒且准确的聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现优异，但尚未应用于聚类任务，因此探索其在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 采用师生范式训练：教师通过随机扩散采样生成多样聚类分配，学生将其优化为稳定预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，达到无监督分类的最新性能。

Conclusion: CLUDI为高维数据聚类提供了新方法，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Result: 成功将动作语言C+的语义用ASPMT重新表述，并利用SMT求解器计算语言。

Conclusion: ASPMT为逻辑编程提供了更灵活的表达能力，尤其在处理连续资源累积效应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

### [51] [SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04348)
*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartThinker框架通过两阶段学习实现对推理链长度的细粒度控制，减少冗余推理，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理时存在冗余和低效问题，全局长度惩罚方法效果不佳，需更精细的控制。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）通过拒绝采样和监督微调适应短推理模式；2）应用SCPO优化模型输出分布，实现步骤级长度控制。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SmartThinker显著减少冗余推理，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过步骤级长度控制，在保持或提升性能的同时提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebSynthesis框架通过虚拟环境模拟和树状规划，解决了真实环境中状态不可控和API成本高的问题，提升了代理的自学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实或沙盒环境中状态不稳定、难以复现以及API成本高昂的问题，以支持代理的规模化自学习。

Method: 利用学习的世界模型模拟虚拟网络环境，结合树状规划生成多样化高质量轨迹，用于优化代理策略。

Result: 实验表明，使用小规模合成数据训练的代理性能可媲美或超越基于大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化、可互操作的智能体生态系统提供了理论与实践结合的框架，解决了无需中央协调的规模化需求。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba和线性Transformer的双通道时间序列预测模型DC-Mamber，结合了局部和全局特征提取的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在多元时间序列预测中存在局部或全局特征建模的局限性，需要一种兼顾两者的方法。

Method: DC-Mamber采用双通道设计，Mamba通道提取变量内特征（局部），Transformer通道建模跨时间步全局依赖，并通过融合层整合。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，DC-Mamber在预测准确性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber通过结合Mamba和线性Transformer的优势，有效提升了多元时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中因事实错误而受限，现有方法未充分利用token和layer的联合动态。

Method: 引入token感知、layer定位的对比解码方法，通过注意力分析识别关键模式，选择性抑制特定token类型的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练或模型修改，显著提升了多种大语言模型和基准测试的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合动态优化，有效提升了大语言模型的事实生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡历史药物与新药物的使用，需更灵活适应患者病情变化。

Method: 结合分段时间学习（区分近期与远期历史）和自适应响应机制（动态调整新旧药物关注度）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于现有方法，推荐更准确。

Conclusion: ARMR通过动态适应患者状态，提升了药物推荐的个性化和准确性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in
serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation
remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is
then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Conclusion: 语言分析可深化对自发认知状态的理解，验证并更新现有理论。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Conclusion: 千脑系统是AI领域一种有前景的新方法，Monty的初步成果验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Conclusion: TRAP框架在异常检测中表现出色，具有噪声鲁棒性和泛化能力，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合偏好数据下的决策提供了新思路，展示了其在隐私保护推荐系统中的潜力。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管XAI有助于提高AI系统的透明度，但其方法可能泄露个人隐私数据，目前缺乏针对此类隐私攻击的防御措施。

Method: 研究评估了三种PETs（合成训练数据、差分隐私训练和噪声添加）在两类基于特征的XAI方法中的效果。

Result: 最佳情况下，PETs将攻击风险降低了49.47%，同时保持了模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: 研究提出了在XAI中使用PETs的策略，以最大化其益处并最小化隐私攻击的成功率。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Motivation: 传统工程方法在智能系统扩展中表现不佳，需要新的系统原则来支持通用智能的工程化。

Method: 基于抽象系统理论和必要多样性法则，提出“核心与外围”框架，并通过数学定义核心主导与外围主导系统。

Result: 实证研究表明该框架适用于生物和人工智能系统，验证了其实际意义。

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统工程提供了新的理论基础，并展示了理论与实践的桥梁。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的时序变化，现有方法未能有效消除多尺度时间序列中的冗余共享特征，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 设计了时间解耦模块，分别捕获尺度共享和尺度特定的时序表示，并引入两种正则化项以确保共享表示的一致性和特定表示的差异性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DisMS-TS的准确率最高提升9.71%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度时间序列中的冗余特征，显著提升了时间序列分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

TL;DR: MoPPS是一种基于贝叶斯风险预测的框架，通过在线估计提示难度，减少对LLM交互的需求，从而加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖频繁的LLM推理调用，计算成本高，需要更高效的提示选择方法。

Method: MoPPS通过建模提示成功率为潜在变量，进行流式贝叶斯推断，并在多臂老虎机中应用后验采样，实现高效的提示选择。

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM调用并加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种计算高效的提示选择方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Conclusion: 结论是现代对话AI需从输入级过滤转向协议级验证，确保对话上下文的完整性。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRS）中数据的长尾分布导致对高频内容的过度拟合和低频内容的稀疏性，影响推荐的多样性和冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS采用三层策略：(i) 自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）动态调整权重；(ii) 原型学习稳定表示；(iii) GPT-4驱动的对话增强生成多样对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10提升7-15%，人类评估显示其流畅性、信息量和长尾相关性更优。

Conclusion: 多层协作策略有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用分层奖励系统，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈，通过强化学习训练LLM。

Result: 在RTLLM基准测试中，生成的27个RTL设计超越了人工编写的代码的PPA指标。

Conclusion: ChipSeek-R1展示了将工具链反馈集成到LLM训练中的有效性，强化学习有望实现自动化生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链（CoTs）在解决简单问题时过于冗长，导致上下文浪费、延迟增加和能耗上升。

Method: 通过提取和注入“转向向量”在模型的残差流激活空间中切换推理模式，实现推理步骤的压缩。

Result: ASC在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上实现了67.43%的推理步骤压缩，同时保持准确性，并在8B模型上平均提速2.73倍。

Conclusion: ASC是一种无需训练的实用高效工具，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的推理任务部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故严重性预测因数据不完整、特征依赖性强和类别不平衡而困难重重，现有方法难以应对现实噪声且缺乏可解释性。

Method: MARBLE采用多智能体协作，每个智能体专注于特定特征子集（如空间、环境、时间），并通过规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调预测。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE准确率接近90%，显著优于传统机器学习方法和SOTA提示推理方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架，重新定义了分类性能的上限。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AA-CBR模型中可能包含无关案例（spikes）的问题，提升分类的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 引入支持机制，使案例在辩论中支持或攻击其他案例的标签，从而避免无关案例的干扰。

Result: 证明sAA-CBR不含无关案例，同时保留了模型的关键特性。

Conclusion: sAA-CBR通过支持机制有效解决了AA-CBR的局限性，是一种更可靠的分类模型。

Abstract: We introduce Supported Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(sAA-CBR), a binary classification model in which past cases engage in debates
by arguing in favour of their labelling and attacking or supporting those with
opposing or agreeing labels. With supports, sAA-CBR overcomes the limitation of
its precursor AA-CBR, which can contain extraneous cases (or spikes) that are
not included in the debates. We prove that sAA-CBR contains no spikes, without
trading off key model properties

TL;DR: 论文比较了模仿学习（IL）与强化学习（RL）在手术动作规划中的表现，发现IL优于RL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在手术动作规划中，IL和RL哪种方法更有效，尤其是RL是否如预期优于IL。

Method: 提出了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL表现最佳（34.6% mAP），而所有RL方法均表现较差（最低3.1% mAP）。分析表明IL在专家标注测试集上更优。

Conclusion: 挑战了RL在序列决策中优于IL的假设，为手术AI开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Pearl的因果理论，将其应用于分层溯因逻辑程序，证明其稳定模型可解释为因果系统，并验证其符合哲学因果原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何将因果知识应用于逻辑程序，以支持对外部干预的预测和推理。

Method: 将分层溯因逻辑程序转化为因果系统，验证其稳定模型语义是否符合因果原则。

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性和未观测效应无关性等哲学原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模和干预预测的有效框架。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

TL;DR: 论文提出StableRule框架，解决知识图谱推理中因未知选择偏差和分布偏移导致的OOD问题，通过特征解耦和规则学习提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱推理方法依赖I.I.D假设，但实际中可能因未知选择偏差或分布偏移导致性能下降，限制了其在实际环境中的应用。

Method: 提出StableRule框架，结合特征解耦和规则学习网络，以增强OOD泛化能力。

Result: 在七个基准知识图谱上的实验表明，该框架在异构环境中表现优异且稳定。

Conclusion: StableRule框架显著提升了知识图谱推理在OOD场景下的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖重叠用户进行知识迁移，但联合训练难以处理不同分布的数据，而预训练加微调不适合持续集成新数据。

Method: 提出GIST模型，采用CBJT模块对齐内容-行为分布，结合ASI策略增强知识迁移。

Result: 实验证明GIST优于现有方法，并在小红书平台成功部署，显著提升广告系统性能。

Conclusion: GIST通过创新的训练策略和知识迁移方法，有效解决了跨域点击率预测的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of

vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an

Result: X-Masters在HLE上以32.1%的成绩创下新纪录，超越OpenAI和Google的26.6%和26.9%。

Conclusion: X-Masters为复杂任务解决提供了新思路，为未来模型训练积累了经验。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Motivation: 异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时适应队友策略是成功关键，尤其在时间压力和复杂动态任务中。

Result: 在Overcooked环境中，TALENTS优于基线，能有效适应陌生人类队友。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架为异构团队协作提供了有效的自适应解决方案。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现CoT在作为后合理化工具时存在不可靠性，尤其是在防止严重危害的运行时监控中，需要关注监控性而非忠实性。

Method: 提出区分CoT-as-rationalization和CoT-as-computation的框架，并通过增加行为难度强制模型暴露推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，模型在获得详细策略或优化监控时可能隐藏意图，但CoT监控仍能提供有效防御。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽非完美，但作为防御层需持续压力测试和主动保护。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a

This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that

Motivation: 手动设计系统指令资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法生成的软提示缺乏可读性。

Result: 实验表明SI-Agent在任务性能、可读性和效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SI-Agent在性能和可解释性之间取得平衡，有望推动LLM定制化和透明度，但面临计算成本和反馈可靠性的挑战。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

Motivation: 解决GraphRAG因高计算成本和延迟而难以在企业环境中广泛应用的问题。

Method: 1. 依赖知识图谱构建管道，利用工业级NLP库提取实体和关系；2. 轻量级图检索策略，结合混合查询节点识别和一跳遍历。

Result: 在SAP数据集上表现优异，性能提升15%（LLM-as-Judge）和4.35%（RAGAS），依赖构建方法达到LLM生成图谱94%的性能。

Conclusion: 验证了GraphRAG在企业级应用中的可行性，具有低成本、高扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Motivation: 现有结构化提示策略局限于单智能体环境，且忽视多智能体环境中的效率、模块化和可扩展性。

Method: 将智能体交互组件（任务、计划、反馈等）编码为模块化伪代码，加入控制结构和类型变量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，规划性能提升3-36%，输入输出token使用减少55-87%和41-70%。

Conclusion: CodeAgents在多智能体系统中显著提升规划性能和token效率，支持可扩展开发。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

### [91] [Memory Mosaics at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03285)
*Jianyu Zhang,Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模（llama-8B）和真实数据集上保持了其组合性和上下文学习能力，显著优于Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Memory Mosaics在更大规模和真实数据集上的性能，并探索其与Transformer模型的对比。

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B规模，训练1万亿token，引入架构改进（v2），并在三个维度评估：训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer相当，在新任务推理上显著优于Transformer，且无法通过增加Transformer训练数据复制其优势。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模上表现出色，尤其在处理新任务时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，通过线性时序逻辑（LTL）指导LLM，结合语言模型的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证，提升长期规划任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在长期规划任务中容易累积错误，导致不安全或低效行为，限制了其通用性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，LLM actor负责高层动作选择，LTLCrit critic通过LTL分析轨迹并提出新约束，避免未来不安全或低效行为。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘任务中，实现了100%完成率，并比基线LLM规划器更高效。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种安全、通用的决策范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用和生物医学嵌入模型在神经科学领域的信息检索任务中表现不足，需要领域特定的嵌入架构。

Method: 使用50万精心构建的三元组（查询-正例-负例配置）和50万神经科学特定定义条目及知识图谱三元组，基于FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023模型进行多目标优化微调。

Result: 在2.4万神经科学特定查询的测试集上，性能显著优于现有通用和生物医学嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定嵌入架构对神经科学导向的RAG系统和临床自然语言处理应用至关重要。

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR（对象状态情境感知系统）通过识别烹饪中对象状态，为非视觉烹饪提供实时进度追踪支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对视觉障碍者具有挑战性，现有系统缺乏对对象状态（如食材和工具的变化）的追踪和反馈支持。

Method: OSCAR整合食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，实现实时步骤追踪。

Result: 在173个教学视频和12个真实烹饪会话中，对象状态显著提升步骤预测准确性，并揭示影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为非视觉烹饪提供了一种有效的上下文感知支持方法，并贡献了数据集和设计见解。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在企业API调用中常因工具相似或参数不明确而失败，需要一种方法来解决这些问题。

Method: DiaFORGE采用三阶段流程：生成多轮对话、监督微调开源模型、动态评估模型表现。

Result: 在DiaBENCH基准测试中，DiaFORGE训练模型的工具调用成功率比GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet分别高出27和49个百分点。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为企业级工具调用代理提供了一种可靠的解决方案，并公开了相关数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决结构化输出在LLM推理中的性能折衷问题，以及探索非结构化推理的潜力。

Method: 采用iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON与非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试中进行比较。

Result: 非结构化推理表现更优，尤其在MATH基准测试中提升显著；零样本非结构化推理甚至优于五样本结构化推理。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新评估复杂问题解决中对结构化格式的依赖，并探讨复合系统的组织方式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Conclusion: 本综述为研究人员利用AI/ML突破瓶颈、加速药物发现提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Result: 指出当前研究可能存在的陷阱，如过度拟人化、依赖轶事和描述性分析，缺乏理论框架。

Conclusion: 建议AI阴谋研究应避免历史错误，并提出了推动研究的科学严谨性的具体步骤。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工假设，忽略复杂非线性关系，需自动化工具发现影像表型与多模态数据的关联。

Method: 多学科AI代理（心脏病学、生物力学等）通过自组织推理动态生成共识，构建自动化PheWAS流程。

Result: 在心血管影像研究中，MESHAgents发现超出标准变量的关联，疾病分类AUC差异仅-0.004，6/9疾病召回率提升。

Conclusion: MESHAgents提供可扩展、透明的临床影像表型发现方法，性能媲美专家驱动方法。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Result: 明确了监督与控制的定义、适用场景及局限性，提出实践指导。

Conclusion: 区分监督与控制有助于AI系统的实际应用，但仍需进一步技术突破。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效表示和学习接近最优的任务分配策略，适用于不同维度的状态和动作空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态任务分配问题提供了一种通用的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Motivation: 解决在ORAN架构中，LLM微调成本高且资源密集的问题，探索RAG方法的有效性。

Method: 使用ORAN规范对Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG进行对比评估，基于生成指标（如事实正确性、上下文相关性等）。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现优于传统RAG，Hybrid GraphRAG事实正确性提升8%，GraphRAG上下文相关性提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG是更高效的替代方案，适用于ORAN等高要求领域。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流生成和进化优化，有效解决了现有MAS框架的局限性，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

*Rebekah A. Gelpí,Eric Xue,William A. Cunningham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合大语言模型（LLM）和贝叶斯逆向规划模型的混合方法，用于机器心智理论（ToM）任务，以提升预测准确性和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯逆向规划模型在复杂场景中扩展性不足，而LLM方法在推理任务中存在脆弱性。结合两者优势以提升ToM任务的性能。

Method: 使用LLM生成假设和似然函数，结合贝叶斯逆向规划模型计算后验概率，预测代理的心理状态。

Result: 混合方法在ToM任务中表现优于单独使用LLM或链式思维提示的模型，且适用于开放式任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为ToM模型的未来发展和社交智能生成代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

*Qika Lin,Fangzhi Xu,Hao Lu,Kai He,Rui Mao,Jun Liu,Erik Cambria,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经符号推理框架Tunsr，用于知识图谱推理，解决了现有方法无法有效结合神经与符号推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，未能整合两者的优势，且无法满足多样化推理任务的需求。

Method: Tunsr引入了一致的推理图结构，通过前向逻辑消息传递机制更新节点表示和注意力，并提出了FARI算法归纳一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在19个数据集上的实验表明，Tunsr在四种推理场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功统一了神经与符号推理，并适应多样化推理场景，为知识图谱推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在跨学科研究中的应用，强调其作为辅助工具的潜力，并通过计算生物学案例展示了其促进协作的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在研究中受到质疑，需明确其优劣势以实现负责任的使用。

Method: 提出整合LLMs的路线图，并通过计算生物学案例（HIV反弹动力学建模）展示其应用。

Result: LLMs在人类主导的框架下能有效促进跨学科协作与研究。

Conclusion: 负责任地使用LLMs将推动跨学科创新并加速科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过基于代理的架构增强LLM问答系统的推理能力，自动解决提问中的不完整或模糊问题，缩短交互时间并提高答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM问答系统在多轮交互中可能因上下文不清晰而显得繁琐，希望通过代理架构自动解决提问中的缺陷，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 采用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解决和回答三个动作处理提问中的不完整或模糊问题。

Result: 实验显示代理架构能缩短交互时间、提高答案质量，并解释问题缺陷，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 代理架构在大多数情况下优于传统方法，是构建更鲁棒问答系统的有效机制。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

behavior of the proposed mathematical formulations, providing comprehensive
insights into their performance.

Motivation: 探索NEAT算法在复杂视觉输入和高难度游戏环境中的适用性，尤其是在缺乏直接API支持的情况下。

Method: 利用DSAPI框架提取游戏数据，通过NEAT算法从像素数据直接进化神经网络，生成战斗策略。

Result: 进化后的智能体在击败初始Boss时达到35%的成功率。

Conclusion: 视觉神经进化在复杂游戏环境中具有潜力，尤其适用于缺乏明确状态表示的场景。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于代理和大型语言模型的框架，通过员工交互迭代重建数据集描述，解决组织隐性知识记录难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织隐性知识记录面临信息不完整、难以识别专家、正式与非正式网络交织及提问技巧等挑战。

Method: 采用基于SI（易感-感染）过程的代理模型，结合大型语言模型，模拟不同公司结构和传播参数下的知识传播。

Result: 代理模型实现94.9%的知识完整回忆，自我反馈与外部文献评分高度相关，且无需直接访问领域专家即可恢复信息。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效应对组织复杂性，捕获碎片化知识，提升隐性知识记录效率。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出RELRaE框架，利用大语言模型从XML数据中提取关系标签，支持实验室数据的知识图谱转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室机器人产生的XML数据需要转换为知识图谱以实现数据互操作性，但XML模式需先扩展为本体模式。

Method: 使用RELRaE框架，分阶段利用大语言模型提取和标注XML模式中的隐含关系。

Result: 研究表明大语言模型能有效生成关系标签，支持半自动本体生成。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在实验室自动化及半自动本体生成框架中具有重要价值。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

### [115] [Economic Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03834)
*Michael J. Zellinger,Matt Thomson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于经济评估的LLM性能比较框架，量化了错误成本、延迟成本和查询放弃成本，发现推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pareto前沿方法无法比较具有不同优缺点的LLM的问题，提供一种经济视角的性能评估方法。

Method: 提出经济评估框架，将LLM性能权衡量化为单一数值，基于具体用例的经济约束（错误成本、延迟成本、查询放弃成本）。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单一大模型在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先选择性能最强的模型，而非最小化部署成本，因为错误的经济影响远大于部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uni-RAG框架结合多模态检索与生成模型，提升教育内容检索与生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以应对教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发Uni-Retrieval模块，结合Prompt Bank和MoE-LoRA技术，并与语言模型集成形成Uni-RAG。

Result: 在SER等基准测试中，Uni-RAG在检索准确性和生成质量上优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为错误是源于代理缺陷还是环境不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，区分行为错误来源（代理缺陷或环境问题）变得困难但至关重要。

Method: AIProbe通过拉丁超立方采样生成多样化环境配置和任务，并使用基于搜索的规划器独立解决任务，对比代理与规划器表现以识别错误来源。

Result: 评估显示AIProbe在检测总错误和独特错误方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于可靠部署自主代理，有效区分代理缺陷与环境不可行性。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨认知科学的中心问题：认知的原始表征构建块及其组合规则，并评估神经网络（尤其是LLMs）在此领域的适用性。

Method: 通过四个实验，比较LLMs与pLoT模型在逻辑规则归纳任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在拟合人类行为上表现优于或等同于pLoT模型，且预测的规则性质不同，表明LLMs并非pLoT的简单实现。

Conclusion: LLMs可能为解释人类逻辑概念提供新的理论框架，值得未来认知科学研究关注。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个公开的幻灯片动画数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型，在多个指标上优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏原生动画支持，且视觉语言模型因缺少公开数据集和时序推理能力不足而难以处理动画任务。

Method: 发布了包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上显著优于基线模型，尤其在细节保真度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CortexDebate的新方法，通过稀疏辩论图和MDM模块优化多智能体辩论，解决了现有方法中的输入过长和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论方法存在输入过长导致性能下降和过度自信降低辩论效果的问题。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建稀疏辩论图，引入MDM模块优化辩论结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

TL;DR: MUS-ASP是一个基于答案集编程（ASP）的框架，用于在线枚举最小不可满足子集（MUS），显著提升了枚举和计数任务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因是许多应用中的关键问题，而MUS是捕捉这一点的有效工具。当前研究主要集中在枚举和计数MUS上。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP的知识表示和计算效率优势，设计了MUS-ASP框架。

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在MUS枚举和计数任务中表现高效，尤其是在混合求解器中集成时。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP框架通过ASP的强项，显著提升了MUS枚举和计数的效率，为相关应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提升大语言模型（LLM）在跨域任务中的不确定性量化性能，但结果并不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM常生成高置信度但事实错误的回答，需改进其不确定性量化方法以评估输出质量。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并筛选最具信息量的隐藏状态特征，以提升跨域性能。

Result: 实验表明，引入数据无关特征在多数情况下提升性能，但某些情况下反而降低；筛选隐藏状态特征也未一致增强效果。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征的结合效果因情况而异，需进一步研究特征权重分配问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search

algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its

Motivation: 解决静态基准与动态法律实践之间的差距，推动法律智能的发展。

Method: 开发了交互式法律环境J1-ENVS和评估框架J1-EVAL，测试了17个LLM代理。

Result: 许多模型在法律知识上表现良好，但在动态环境中的程序执行上表现不佳，GPT-4o总体表现低于60%。

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，研究为未来方向提供了见解。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中跨平台互操作性差、任务调度静态化及资源同步不足的问题。

Method: 提出五层模块化框架（用户、工作流、操作、智能体、资源），包含16个标准化接口，支持任务解析、调度优化和资源抽象。

Result: 通过CreAgentive原型验证，提升吞吐量、降低调用复杂度并增强可控性。

Conclusion: HAWK具有灵活性和扩展性，未来可应用于医疗、金融等领域，并需进一步研究幻觉缓解和实时性能优化。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：先用Llama 3.1 8B模仿Llama 3.3 70B进行监督微调，再进行策略强化学习。通过1,370种配置的采样和自助法优化超参数。

Result: 结合监督微调和强化学习的策略在WorkArena和MiniWob++上表现优于单一方法，仅需55%的计算成本即可达到纯监督微调的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了计算效率，缩小了与闭源模型的差距，为开源LLM网络代理的发展提供了实用方案。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective

Method: 利用热力学类比（Mpemba效应）分析“谷-河”损失景观，推导最优学习率条件。

Result: 发现高平台期能加速损失下降，存在“强Mpemba点”使收敛更快。

Conclusion: 为平台期调度提供了理论依据，指导LLM学习率调优。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust

teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Conclusion: ASPMT为逻辑编程和理论求解提供了新的集成框架，扩展了动作语言的应用范围，特别是在连续变化建模方面。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

TL;DR: SmartThinker框架通过两阶段学习，实现对推理链长度的细粒度控制，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理时存在冗余和低效问题，现有方法通过全局长度惩罚导致关键步骤压缩不足或非关键步骤冗余保留。

Method: SmartThinker采用两阶段框架：1）通过拒绝采样和监督微调（SFT）适应短形式推理；2）应用Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization（SCPO）优化模型输出分布。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SmartThinker显著减少冗余推理，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过细粒度控制推理链长度，有效解决了冗余问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOD-X是一种新型的模块化开放去中心化交换架构，旨在解决异构智能体间的互操作性问题，通过分层设计、通用消息总线、状态管理和区块链安全机制实现高效集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统从单一模型发展为专业化智能体生态系统，现有通信协议无法满足异构智能体间的互操作性需求，亟需标准化解决方案。

Method: MOD-X采用分层架构，包括通用消息总线、状态管理、翻译能力和区块链安全机制，支持发布-订阅通信模型、语义能力发现和动态工作流编排。

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化智能体生态系统提供了理论形式化与实践结合的框架，解决了现有协议的局限性，推动了智能体互操作性的发展。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DC-Mamber结合Mamba和线性Transformer，通过双通道策略分别提取变量内特征和全局依赖，提升了多元时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在多元时间序列预测中各有局限：Transformer全局依赖强但局部敏感性不足且计算复杂度高；Mamba计算高效但全局信息整合能力弱。

Method: 提出DC-Mamber，采用双通道设计：Mamba通道（通道独立策略）提取变量内特征，Transformer通道（通道混合策略）建模全局依赖。通过嵌入层、编码器和融合层实现特征整合。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上验证，DC-Mamber的预测准确性优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber通过结合Mamba和Transformer的优势，有效解决了多元时间序列预测中的局部和全局建模问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中因事实错误而受限，现有解码方法未能充分利用令牌与层之间的联合动态关系。

Method: 通过经验性注意力分析，识别令牌类型与层的关系，选择性抑制特定令牌类型的注意力，生成对比信号指导解码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练或模型修改，显著提升了多种大语言模型和基准测试的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合令牌与层的关系，有效提升了模型的事实生成能力，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡历史药物和新药物的使用，尤其是在患者病情变化时。

Method: ARMR结合分段时间学习（区分近期和远期历史）和自适应响应机制（动态调整对新旧药物的关注）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供更个性化的推荐。

Conclusion: ARMR通过改进时间理解和动态调整，提升了药物推荐的准确性和个性化。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in
serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation
remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language

then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Motivation: 研究自发思维的动态互动及其语言表现，以更新和验证现有理论。

Method: 分析参与者描述这些思维类型的语言模式特征。

Result: Deja Vu以抽象和空间语言为特征，非自愿自传体记忆富含个人情感细节，意外思维表现为不可预测性和认知中断。

Conclusion: 语言可作为揭示自发认知状态表达的重要工具，验证并补充了现有理论。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Motivation: 当前AI系统在任务表现上出色，但缺乏生物智能的核心特性，如快速持续学习、基于感知运动的表征和结构化知识。通过模仿哺乳动物大脑的皮质柱结构，千脑系统试图缩小生物与人工智能的差距。

Method: 研究评估了首个千脑系统Monty在3D物体识别和姿态估计任务中的表现，使用YCB数据集，测试其基于感知运动的学习、模块化架构和投票算法。

Result: Monty通过结构化表征实现了鲁棒的泛化能力，能够分类物体全局形状并检测对称性；模块化设计和投票算法加速了推理速度；Hebbian-like绑定机制支持高效持续学习。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的新AI方法，Monty的初步成果验证了其在泛化、推理和学习效率上的潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义阈值或监督学习，面对未知场景、传感器噪声和遮挡时效果下降，且需要大量标注数据。

Method: 提出TRAP框架，通过逆向强化学习推断潜在驾驶意图，结合奖励和最坏情况监督隐式学习时间信用分配，并利用变时长采样预训练。

Result: 在14,000+模拟轨迹上测试，AUC达0.90，F1-score为82.2%，召回率和F1-score分别比基线高39%和12%。

Conclusion: TRAP在噪声鲁棒性和未知异常类型泛化性上表现优异，为自动驾驶异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法规和技术限制，推荐系统只能获取群体偏好数据，无法直接访问用户个体数据，这导致个性化推荐面临探索与利用的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Rec-APC模型，基于已知用户类型先验分布，通过贝叶斯更新处理二元反馈（正反馈更新后验，负反馈终止会话），并设计分支定界算法计算最优策略。

Result: 实验证明Rec-APC在合成数据和MovieLens数据上表现优于POMDP求解器SARSOP，尤其在用户类型数量较多时。

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合偏好数据下的决策问题提供了有效解决方案，并启发了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Result: 最佳情况下，PETs将攻击风险降低了49.47%，同时保持了模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: 研究提出了在XAI中使用PETs的策略，以最大化隐私保护效果并最小化攻击成功率。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统工程提供了新的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的时序变化，现有方法在多尺度分析中未能有效消除冗余共享特征，导致模型对共享特征的关注不均衡。

Method: 设计了时间解耦模块，分别捕获共享和特定尺度的时序表示，并引入两种正则化项以确保共享表示的一致性和特定尺度表示的差异性。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度时间序列中的共享和特定特征，显著提升了分类性能，为解决复杂时序模式提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少训练所需的LLM调用次数。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种高效且自适应的提示选择方法，显著降低了强化学习微调的计算负担。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Motivation: 研究动机是发现对话接口的依赖引入了新的攻击面，尤其是模型对自身历史对话的信任导致的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 结论指出现代对话AI需从输入级过滤转向协议级验证，以确保对话上下文的完整性。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LumiCRS通过自适应综合焦点损失、原型学习和GPT-4驱动的对话增强模块，解决了对话推荐系统中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了推荐的准确性、多样性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRSs）存在长尾数据分布不均的问题，导致推荐偏向热门项目，牺牲多样性并加剧冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS采用三层策略：(i) 自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）动态调整类别权重；(ii) 原型学习稳定长尾项目表示；(iii) GPT-4驱动的对话增强模块生成多样对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10提升了7-15%，且人类评估显示其流畅性、信息量和长尾相关性更优。

Conclusion: 多层协作策略有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1通过分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，训练LLM生成功能正确且PPA优化的RTL代码，在标准基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时优化RTL代码的功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈，训练LLM生成优化的RTL代码。

Result: 在RTLLM基准测试中，ChipSeek-R1生成的27个RTL设计在PPA指标上超越了人工编写的代码。

Conclusion: ChipSeek-R1展示了将工具链反馈集成到LLM训练中的有效性，强化学习有望实现自动化生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

*Seyedarmin Azizi,Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过激活导向压缩（ASC）技术，在不重新训练的情况下缩短大型语言模型的推理链，减少冗余并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在推理时生成的中间步骤（思维链）过于冗长，导致资源浪费和延迟增加，需要一种方法在不影响准确性的前提下压缩推理链。

Method: 提出ASC技术，通过提取和注入“导向向量”来调整模型的隐藏表示，从而生成更简洁的推理链。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上，ASC将推理链长度减少67.43%，同时保持准确性，并在8B模型上实现2.73倍的推理速度提升。

Conclusion: ASC是一种无需训练的高效方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的场景，为推理能力强的语言模型提供了实用的部署工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Result: 在真实HVAC数据和专家QA数据集上表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: JARVIS能高效生成准确、可解释的响应，适用于HVAC系统交互。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Result: 评估三种先进LLMs和两种机器学习模型，最佳LLM性能与最准确机器学习模型相当，且无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: LLMs在交通事故影响预测中具有实际可行性。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Result: 实验结果显示，DoPI系统在问诊结果中达到84.68%的准确率，显著提升了诊断沟通能力。

Conclusion: DoPI系统有效结合了对话能力和专业知识，为中医诊断提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

TL;DR: MARBLE是一种多智能体规则驱动的LLM引擎，通过分解任务和模块化推理，显著提升了交通事故严重性预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 交通事故严重性预测面临数据不完整、特征依赖性强和类别不平衡等挑战，现有方法难以在噪声环境中扩展且缺乏可解释性。

Method: MARBLE采用多智能体系统，每个智能体专注于特定特征子集，通过规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调预测，并保留推理痕迹。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE准确率接近90%，显著优于传统机器学习方法和SOTA提示推理方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架，重新定义了分类性能的上限。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索IL和RL在手术动作规划中的效果差异，以优化实时辅助技术。

Method: 提出了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL表现最佳（34.6% mAP），而RL方法均表现不佳（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在专家标注测试集上，IL优于RL，挑战了RL在序列决策中的优越性假设。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性和未观察效应无关性等哲学原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模和干预预测的有效框架。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

Result: 在七个基准知识图谱上的实验表明，StableRule在异构环境中表现优异且稳定。

Conclusion: StableRule为实际应用中的知识图谱推理提供了鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: GIST通过创新模块和策略，显著提升跨域点击率预测效果，适用于大规模工业场景。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of
healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical
vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to
significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream
applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights,

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时适应队友策略是成功的关键，尤其在时间压力和复杂动态任务中。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略空间，聚类策略类型，训练条件合作者，并结合动态调整算法适应新队友。

Result: 在Overcooked环境中，TALENTS优于现有基线，尤其在陌生人类队友协作中表现突出。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架有效解决了异构团队动态适应问题，为人机协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了链式思维（CoT）监控在AI安全中的可靠性问题，提出监控性而非忠实性是关键，并区分了CoT作为合理化与计算的不同用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现CoT在作为后合理化工具时存在不可靠性，引发对其在AI安全中应用的质疑。本文旨在探讨其在运行时监控中的有效性。

Method: 提出区分CoT-as-rationalization和CoT-as-computation的框架，并通过增加行为难度强制模型暴露推理过程。同时提供压力测试指南。

Result: 实验表明，模型在获得详细策略或迭代优化时可能隐藏意图，但CoT监控仍能提供显著防御层。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽非完美，但在主动保护和持续测试下，可作为有效的安全防御手段。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

### [169] [Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953)
*Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对深度神经网络在嵌入式微控制器上实时运行的二阶剪枝方法的鲁棒性分析，为闭环控制系统的稳定性和安全性提供了数学保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在机器人控制中表现出色，但其庞大的参数量与嵌入式设备的资源限制存在冲突。二阶剪枝方法虽能高效压缩网络，但其对闭环控制性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析非线性离散时间控制系统中的二阶剪枝，推导出剪枝后策略与原始策略之间的误差上界，该上界仅依赖于未剪枝网络的谱范数和偏置。

Result: 提出了一个闭式不等式，能够在剪枝前评估剪枝幅度对控制误差的影响，从而确保剪枝后的网络满足预设的性能要求。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了深度学习工具与安全关键自主系统鲁棒性需求之间的重要空白，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the
robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了图像驱动目标和手势模型，提升了机器人绘画的自然性和协作潜力。

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

Abstract: Replicating human--level dexterity remains a fundamental robotics challenge,

anthropomorphic robotic hand for biomimetic dexterity, and (2) an
optimization--based motion retargeting for real--time, high--fidelity
reproduction of intricate human hand motions and seamless hand--arm
coordination. We validate the system via extensive empirical evaluations,
including dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks and a long--horizon task

nine objects. Experimental results demonstrate its intuitive teleoperation
interface with real--time control and the ability to generate high--quality

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MPC的实时性和适应性，成功应用于微型四旋翼飞行器，并开源实现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of
first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have
excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these
approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their
adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order
Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also
their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online
hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,
achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized
fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache
recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on
a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation
open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for
airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable
motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods
focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on
forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection
to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised
vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of
drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone
trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with
camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We
then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a
self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our
method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that
feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban
scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised
image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,
reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D
labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for
real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance
to support reproducible research in the robotics community.

Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous
systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection
errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation
framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to
isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a
late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV)
detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF
outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x
lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension
estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between
99.5% and 100%.

Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic
ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a
multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging
the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial
robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter
using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of
two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while
reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint
of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner
to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive
behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing
rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is
controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope
as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,
demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how
the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.
Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of
our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the
potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为燃料自由对接提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低装配力和时间，提高安全性和效率。

Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances
remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for
successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies
solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a
hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through
primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping
it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate
that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force
application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five
industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances,
achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based
insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces,
and overall insertion times, showing our method significantly reduces the

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视觉对齐问题，提升了机器人模仿学习的效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in
robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data.
To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing
specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use
human hand demonstrations to obtain training data.However, the former requires
both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the
latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand
demonstrations and the deployed robot observations.To address this, we propose
a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper
generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper
demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap.Specifically, a GoPro
fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand
demonstrations.We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of
paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed
using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both
timestamps and observations.Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we
are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate
them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation
pipeline for training robotic policy model.In experiments, the robust
manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated
robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data
collection method.More demonstrations can be found at: https://rwor.github.io/

Conclusion: 该方法具有机器人无关性，适用于模块化系统，并作为开源框架Motion-Stack的核心接口。

Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where
reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective
missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision
tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot
interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in
monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for
synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting
dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design
makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To
ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained
within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric
can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control,
deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible
with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for
Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination
(available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated
by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs,
evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external
disturbances.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and
generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding
expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots
is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding
a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear
matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on
the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant
computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as
floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of
learning stable DSs with BMIs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality,
geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately
estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time
that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively
address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a
lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance
cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth
completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas,
significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To
enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise
Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed
CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally
reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly
incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the
continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose
estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream
applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame
interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we
construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth
poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence
novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected
datasets demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our system across LiDAR
sensors with varying sampling densities. Both the dataset and code will be made
publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.

Method: 提出ROLT方法，结合肢体标记化和一致性dropout，增强泛化能力和抗噪性。

Result: 在四足和六足机器人实验中，ROLT在未知动态和噪声条件下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROLT通过新颖的网络设计实现了对未知条件的高鲁棒性，无需复杂训练技巧。

Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ
from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for
legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here
we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While
previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation
techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our
approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could
achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key
designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports
knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of
the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's
robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on
quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than
existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned
policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally,
despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging
corruption noise during testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内机器人导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏灵活性或需手动调整，而学习型方法能直接从数据中学习，但缺乏与传统方法的直接对比。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用专家（操纵杆）演示训练基于RGB图像、LiDAR及两者结合的导航策略网络，并与传统势场导航方法对比。

Result: 多模态模型在多数场景中表现更优，但在动态环境中因演示多样性不足而受限。

Conclusion: IL可直接从数据中学习并泛化到不同布局，是一种实用的导航方法，并可能作为终身学习的初始化策略。

Abstract: Traditional indoor robot navigation methods provide a reliable solution when
adapted to constrained scenarios, but lack flexibility or require manual
re-tuning when deployed in more complex settings. In contrast, learning-based
approaches learn directly from sensor data and environmental interactions,
enabling easier adaptability. While significant work has been presented in the
context of learning navigation policies, learning-based methods are rarely
compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for
their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we
explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using
expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks
based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL
approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate
the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a
camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates
superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in
dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across
layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and
potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种运动任务（如平地行走、崎岖地形和爬楼梯）中表现优于单智能体和基线多智能体方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模拟人类手臂运动，显著提升了人形机器人的平衡性和运动鲁棒性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body
dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this
principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots
through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic
structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but
decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular
momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant
behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking
and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum
and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during
locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with
single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a
humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion
tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair
climbing.

Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an
immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During
the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed.
However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others,
completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized
path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38%
faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks,
immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study
highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting
limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that
immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in
precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进的TTC2D方法，分别引入车辆航向信息、适应铰接式车辆以及放宽速度恒定假设，以更全面地预测碰撞风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC2D方法假设车辆航向相同且恒定，且未考虑铰接式车辆，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 开发了三种改进的TTC2D版本：1) 引入航向信息；2) 适应铰接式车辆；3) 放宽速度恒定假设，允许恒定加速度。在CARLA仿真环境中测试。

Result: 改进版本不仅能检测追尾碰撞（类似TTC），还能识别侧碰风险（TTC无法预测）。

Conclusion: 改进的TTC2D方法扩展了碰撞预测能力，适用于更复杂的车辆类型和动态场景。

Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time
until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain
constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture
sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was
introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same
heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in
addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its
use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This
paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of
TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is
missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed
and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to
articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The
third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the
constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are
tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect
rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe
risks, something TTC could not predict.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了局部最优问题，提升了四足机器人配备机械臂的操控性能。

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique
loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This
integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in
modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution
to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through
interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when
exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit
kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration
provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's
workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the
local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a
DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂结构下的导线排列设计提供了有效工具，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Conclusion: 优化调度方法可显著提升植物工厂中机器人采摘的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize
resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these
environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework
that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks,
minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations.
Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ
pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability.
Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with
that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly
double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides.
Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant
reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These
results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in
improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant
factories.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory
refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological
relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction
precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement
approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological
structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention
captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by
considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft
intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model
interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction
accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively
refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance
interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant
performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢-快协同推理和自验证机制，有效减少空间幻觉，平衡物理稳定性和语义一致性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Result: 在振动平台和移动平台的实验中，该方法在LiDAR经历强烈振动时表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模去畸变误差和不确定性，显著提高了LiDAR在强烈振动环境下的定位精度。

Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense
high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial
odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging
due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2)
unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First,
we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and
assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this
uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware
residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We
conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public
datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves
better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic
changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a
time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to
inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be
synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware
synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of
event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.
Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization
method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing
the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras
and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate
that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses
with multiple models of event cameras.

Conclusion: 该研究为异构激光雷达平台的SLAM和3D重建研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such
as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent
advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective
solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its
dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable
performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,
such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars
significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across
platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state
and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently
examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from
multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped
Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.
Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively
includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state
and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark
evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor
data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud
registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and
hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar
systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for
future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar
platforms.

Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied
artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their
perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves
handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences
of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers
significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at
multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this
work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes
wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages
learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation
analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the
design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting
schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This
framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic
manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the
learned policy.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain
stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and
neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged
sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with
conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising
solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing
interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been
notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of
Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration,
neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art
technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future
research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of
Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high
operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging
technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration,
learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS),
and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to
address these challenges.

<details>

Motivation: 自主地面车辆在有限视野（FOV）下导航时，频繁的遮挡和未观测空间导致安全性和性能挑战。

Method: VA-MPPI将感知不确定性和控制决策结合为双重控制问题，通过统一的规划和控制流程推理感知不确定性演化。

Conclusion: VA-MPPI框架为复杂和遮挡环境中的自主导航提供了鲁棒性解决方案，为未来自主地面车辆系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a
priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles,
particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in
frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel
visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated
as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions
are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a
unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances
exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance
would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against
deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a
cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results
demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision
with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,
in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller
achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic
controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria
rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids
unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed
framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in
unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements
in autonomous ground vehicle systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在保证安全性的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational
efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is
computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may
compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and
safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models.
Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve
notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free
characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can
safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free
trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the
generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,
which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and
control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen
scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while
maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle
further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world
applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few

assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental
understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural
interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote
controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial
knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for
fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate
vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also
offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering,
intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework,
it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward
a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent. The supplementary

Conclusion: SimLauncher证明了大规模仿真预训练对真实世界RL的潜力，为未来研究提供启示。

Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a
longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement
learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in
real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world
faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and
significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a
safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,
while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated
using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a
novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and
real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we
first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,
which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values
using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived
from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from
the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive
experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation
tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly
improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope
this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on
leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic
RL.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Conclusion: VLM-TDP在复杂环境下表现出色，尤其适用于长时程任务。

Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in
short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence
of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided
trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon
manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art
vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,
manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based
trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial
conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and
substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned
Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration
data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation
experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms
classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success
rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in
performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or
altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world
experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in
long-horizon tasks. Videos are available on https://youtu.be/g0T6h32OSC8

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine
systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial
navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed
respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these
filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match
handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this
paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right-
IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the
handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is
properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the
IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves
asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be
included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation
system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of
the two filters.

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction
and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless
switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount
challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive
Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and
human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across
multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of
collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework
overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically
restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and
transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive
model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and
robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By
employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted
features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns
multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent
estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our
framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of
HRC.

Method: PRISM包含三个组件：分割嵌入单元处理点云，交叉注意力融合视觉特征与机器人状态，扩散模块生成平滑动作。

Result: 在每任务100次演示的训练下，PRISM在模拟环境中超越了2D和3D基线策略，表现出高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRISM为复杂环境中的机器人操作提供了高效的模仿学习解决方案。

Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D
perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed
camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point
cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing
their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly
learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need
for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main
components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud
into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a
cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed
robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that
translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on
100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies
in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating
strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are
available on https://github.com/czknuaa/PRISM.

Result: 在真实数据集和实验环境中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了导航效率和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to
operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional
approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps
simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ
human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to
navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high
computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to
unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans
perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.
Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent
essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are
hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,
so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit
local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.
Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring
Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the
topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab
environments. We open our source code at

TL;DR: DRAE结合MoE、RAG和分层RL框架，通过动态路由和外部知识增强，显著提升终身学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身学习中的灾难性遗忘和任务适应问题。

Method: 动态路由MoE、参数化检索RAG、分层RL框架（ReflexNet、SchemaPlanner、HyperOptima）。

Result: 任务成功率82.5%，遗忘率极低，优于传统MoE模型。

Conclusion: DRAE在机器人终身学习中表现出高效、灵活和可扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a
groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing
capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement
power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through
ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert
models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource
allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval
(P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with
ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning,
and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation
and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly
outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge
reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic
robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models.
Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable,
and efficient lifelong learning for robotics.

Conclusion: MOSU通过多模态集成显著提升了户外机器人的导航能力。

Abstract: We present MOSU, a novel autonomous long-range navigation system that
enhances global navigation for mobile robots through multimodal perception and
on-road scene understanding. MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation
challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to
ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS
map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal
trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory
generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for
precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for
traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social
context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments.
This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances
traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We
evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the
GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable
terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global
navigation methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提高强化学习的样本效率，并适应环境或用户偏好的变化。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏奖励场景中具有实际应用价值，如导航策略学习。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved
performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual
comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation
without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of
domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high
computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we
propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent
framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes
in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to
establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before
each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to
update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to
generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery
capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks,
demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We
believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also
contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹数据集在目标域中的应用存在挑战，如域不平衡和计算成本高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: IMMP采用两步流程：预合并以捕获源域行为，再合并以构建可适应目标域的模型。

Result: 在多个规划基准和模型上验证，IMMP表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP为跨域运动规划提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Result: 实验表明，系统显著提高了操作安全性，且不影响任务效率。

Conclusion: 该系统为杂乱环境中的遥操作提供了一种安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is
challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception
and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body,
obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local
robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation.
In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator
control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the
combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance.
Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile
manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger
visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are
integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during
teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our
system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task
efficiency.

Result: 渐近分析与数值模拟一致，揭示了对称性破缺分岔和稳定性转变的条件。

Conclusion: 被动形状变量在非完整系统中对多稳定周期解有重要作用。

Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed
by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled
with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.
joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering
angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model
where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor
attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to
rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes
multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as
well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We
use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under
symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further
scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for
symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the
symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and
structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with
numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape
variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic
systems of robotic locomotion.

Conclusion: Piggyback Camera系统提供了一种低成本、易部署的视觉监控解决方案，适用于商用机器人。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了检测的自动化水平。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of
wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain.
Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the
demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade
stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors,
restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time
blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details
cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we
introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform
is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a
Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced,
achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade
detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate
brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests,
comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind
farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing
inspection autonomy.

Result: 实验证明TTTS在多种任务中高效且能收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: TTTS是一种通用且高效的优化方法，适用于复杂机器人任务。

Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal
control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems
involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and
long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art
optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying
scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to
achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration
across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However,
MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and
high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train
Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the
separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank,
linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation
time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the
bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across
inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion
planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of
TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,

US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset

between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging
the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often
involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements,
design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we
propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify
acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use
domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge
graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of
executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently
specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated
generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture
that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing
on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this
architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the
execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails
differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This
research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems,
contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: 提出LERa框架，包括Look（生成场景描述和识别错误）、Explain（提供纠正指导）和Replan（修改计划）三个步骤。

Result: 在ALFRED-ChaOS和VirtualHome-ChaOS数据集上提升40%性能，在PyBullet模拟器中成功率提升67%。

Conclusion: LERa是一种鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，适用于机器人任务执行中的错误感知和重规划。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning,
but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world
changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,
Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that
utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB
image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure
detection - without additional information such as object detection or
predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The
replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a
scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides
corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.
LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from
both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the
newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%
improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation
tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet
simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,
including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's
effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable
solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统在全局导航信息整合上的不足，模拟人类驾驶环境。

Method: 开发NavigScene数据集，提出三种导航引导范式：导航引导推理、导航引导偏好优化、导航引导视觉-语言-动作模型。

Result: 实验表明方法显著提升感知、预测、规划和问答任务性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动驾驶系统在复杂环境中的导航提供了更可靠和安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于Video-LLM的VLN方法在细粒度视觉理解、长期上下文建模和计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Result: 在VLN-CE基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并保持稳定的低延迟。

Conclusion: StreamVLN通过高效KV缓存重用和上下文管理，为实际部署提供了鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了深度学习工具与安全关键自主系统之间的关键差距，为剪枝方法在控制领域的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the
robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of
first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have
excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these
approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their
adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order
Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also
their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online
hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,
achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized
fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache
recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on
a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation
open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for
airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable
motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods
focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on
forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection
to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised
vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of
drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone
trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with
camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We
then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a
self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our
method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that
feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban
scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised
image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,
reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D
labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for
real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance
to support reproducible research in the robotics community.

Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic
ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a
multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging
the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial
robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter
using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of
two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while
reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint
of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner
to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive
behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing
rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is
controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope
as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,
demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how
the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.
Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of
our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the
potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic
environments.

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances
remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for
successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies
solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a
hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through
primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping
it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate
that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force
application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five
industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances,
achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based
insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces,

Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in
robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data.
To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing
specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use
human hand demonstrations to obtain training data.However, the former requires
both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the
latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand
demonstrations and the deployed robot observations.To address this, we propose
a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper
generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper
demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap.Specifically, a GoPro
fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand
demonstrations.We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of
paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed
using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both
timestamps and observations.Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we
are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate
them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation
pipeline for training robotic policy model.In experiments, the robust
manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated
robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data
collection method.More demonstrations can be found at: https://rwor.github.io/

Result: 方法成功同步了六个异构机器人肢体的末端执行器，验证了轨迹跟踪和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: 该方法具有机器人无关性，适合模块化系统，并作为开源框架Motion-Stack的核心接口。

Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where
reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective
missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision
tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot
interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in
monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for
synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting
dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design
makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To
ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained
within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric
can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control,
deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible
with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for
Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination
(available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated
by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs,
evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external
disturbances.

Motivation: 学习演示（LfD）技术使机器人能够从用户演示中学习和泛化任务，但稳定动态系统的优化问题存在计算资源需求高和数值问题等挑战。

Method: 采用一种新颖的组合方法，优化稳定动态系统的学习过程，特别是针对BMI约束的非凸问题。

Result: 该方法提高了学习稳定动态系统的适用性和可扩展性，减少了计算资源和数值问题的困扰。

Conclusion: 提出的组合方法有效解决了BMI约束优化问题，为LfD技术的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and
generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding
expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots
is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding
a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear
matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on
the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant
computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as
floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of
learning stable DSs with BMIs.

Conclusion: 该系统在多种LiDAR密度下均表现出优越性和多功能性，数据集和代码将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality,
geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately
estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time
that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively
address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a
lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance
cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth
completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas,
significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To
enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise
Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed
CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally
reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly
incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the
continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose
estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream
applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame
interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we
construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth
poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence
novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected
datasets demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our system across LiDAR
sensors with varying sampling densities. Both the dataset and code will be made
publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的鲁棒性运动控制方法ROLT，通过身体标记化和一致性dropout设计，提升了机器人在未知动态和感知条件下的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中机器人需应对训练中未见的动态和感知差异，现有方法依赖复杂训练和适应技术，本文从网络模型角度解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ROLT方法，结合身体标记化（促进肢体间知识共享）和一致性dropout（增强对感知噪声的鲁棒性）。

Result: 在四足和六足机器人实验中，ROLT在未见动态条件和噪声下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROLT展示了在有限训练条件下对多样化未知场景的强泛化能力。

Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ
from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for
legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here
we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While
previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation
techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our
approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could
achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key
designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports
knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of
the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's
robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on
quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than
existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned
policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally,
despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging
corruption noise during testing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了模仿学习（IL）在室内导航中的可行性，通过专家演示训练多种导航策略网络，并与传统势场导航方法对比，结果表明IL在多模态模型中表现更优，但在动态环境中存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内机器人导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏灵活性或需手动调整，而学习型方法能直接从数据中学习，但缺乏与传统方法的直接比较，影响其广泛接受。

Method: 使用专家（操纵杆）演示训练基于RGB图像、LiDAR及两者结合的导航策略网络，并与传统势场导航方法对比。

Result: 多模态模型在多数场景中表现更优，但在动态环境中表现不佳，可能与演示数据多样性不足有关。

Conclusion: IL可直接从数据中学习并泛化到不同布局，是一种实用的导航方法，并可能作为终身学习的初始化策略。

Abstract: Traditional indoor robot navigation methods provide a reliable solution when
adapted to constrained scenarios, but lack flexibility or require manual
re-tuning when deployed in more complex settings. In contrast, learning-based
approaches learn directly from sensor data and environmental interactions,
enabling easier adaptability. While significant work has been presented in the
context of learning navigation policies, learning-based methods are rarely
compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for
their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we
explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using
expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks
based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL
approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate
the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a
camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates
superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in
dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across
layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and
potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在平衡性和适应性上优于单智能体和多智能体基线，并在多种复杂地形任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习框架能够有效协调人形机器人的全身运动，提升其在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body
dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this
principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots
through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic
structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but
decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular
momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant
behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking
and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum
and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during
locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with
single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a
humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion
tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair
climbing.

Result: 人类在扫描阶段表现最佳，而沉浸式VR机器人在治疗阶段效率提升65%，在导航任务中比人类快38%。

Conclusion: 沉浸式VR在精准农业中具有提升效率和精确性的潜力，但需注意模拟逼真度和通用性的限制。

Abstract: This study explores the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a control
interface for agricultural robots in vineyard disease detection and treatment.
Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an
immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During
the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed.
However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others,
completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized
path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38%
faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks,
immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study
highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting
limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that
immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in
precision agriculture.

*Abhijeet Behera,Sogol Kharrazi,Erik Frisk,Maytheewat Aramrattana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进的二维碰撞时间（TTC$_{\text{2D}}$）方法，分别考虑了车辆航向信息、铰接车辆特性以及非恒定速度情况，并在CARLA仿真环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法假设车辆航向相同且不变，且未考虑铰接车辆特性，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 1. 加入航向信息；2. 适配铰接车辆；3. 允许恒定加速度。在CARLA仿真中测试。

Result: 改进方法不仅能检测追尾碰撞，还能识别侧碰风险，弥补了传统TTC的不足。

Conclusion: 三种改进方法扩展了TTC$_{\text{2D}}$的应用场景，提升了碰撞预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time
until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain
constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture
sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was
introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same
heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in
addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its
use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This
paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of
TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is
missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed
and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to
articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The
third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the
constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are
tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect
rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe
risks, something TTC could not predict.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了局部最优问题，提升了四足机器人配备机械臂的控制性能。

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique
loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This
integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in
modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution
to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through
interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when
exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit
kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration
provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's
workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the
local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a
DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach.

Result: 在三维连杆结构下优化导线排列，验证了方法的有效性，并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂结构下的导线排列优化提供了实用解决方案，克服了传统设计的局限性。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Result: 双臂系统在果实密度均衡时效率接近单臂的两倍，仿真显示吞吐量提高10-20%，且停止次数显著减少。

Conclusion: 优化调度方法可显著提升植物工厂中机器人采摘的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize
resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these
environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework
that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks,
minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations.
Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ
pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability.
Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with
that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly
double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides.
Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant
reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These
results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in
improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant
factories.

Conclusion: SRefiner通过引入拓扑关系，显著提升了多智能体轨迹预测的精度，为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全的决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory
refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological
relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction
precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement
approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological
structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention
captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by
considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft
intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model
interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction
accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively
refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance
interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant
performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮或重叠，且难以平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢系统通过RRG管道提取对象属性和空间约束；快系统生成离散坐标和拓扑关系集，并通过LLM自适应关系库（ARL）联合验证。

Result: 在8种场景中验证，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过闭环自验证和慢快协作推理，显著优化了布局生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Result: 在振动平台和移动平台实验中，该方法在LiDAR强烈振动时表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后去失真不确定性方法有效提升了LIO在强烈振动环境下的性能。

Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense
high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial
odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging
due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2)
unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First,
we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and
assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this
uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware
residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We
conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public
datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves
better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多事件相机的时间同步问题，且无需额外硬件支持。

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic
changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a
time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to
inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be
synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware
synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of
event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.
Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization
method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing
the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras
and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate
that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses
with multiple models of event cameras.

Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such
as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent
advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective
solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its
dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable
performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,
such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars
significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across
platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state
and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently
examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from
multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped
Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.
Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively
includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state
and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark
evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor
data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud
registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and
hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar
systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for
future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar
platforms.

Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied
artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their
perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves
handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences
of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers
significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at
multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this
work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes
wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages
learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation
analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the
design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting
schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This
framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic
manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the
learned policy.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain
stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and
neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged
sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with
conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising
solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing
interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been
notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of
Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration,
neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art
technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future
research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of
Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high
operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging
technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration,
learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS),
and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to
address these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主地面车辆在视野受限的未知环境中导航时，频繁遮挡和未观测空间导致挑战，传统方法难以有效处理感知与控制的不确定性。

Method: VA-MPPI框架将感知不确定性与控制决策结合，通过隐式优化减少不确定性，无需显式目标。

Result: 在仿真测试中，VA-MPPI在复杂场景下显著减少碰撞，成功率高达84%，而确定性控制器仅为8%。

Conclusion: VA-MPPI框架为无结构和遮挡环境中的鲁棒导航提供了新思路，推动了自主地面车辆系统的未来发展。

Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a
priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles,
particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in
frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel
visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated
as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions
are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a
unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances
exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance
would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against
deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a
cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results
demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision
with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,
in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller
achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic
controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria
rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids
unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed
framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in
unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements
in autonomous ground vehicle systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在实际应用中具有实用性，F1TENTH车辆评估验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational
efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is
computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may
compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and
safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models.
Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve
notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free
characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can
safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free
trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the
generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,
which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and
control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen
scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while
maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle
further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world
applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few
obstacles, offer high maneuverability and full three-dimensional mobility. This

challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection,
aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a

assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental
understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural
interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote
controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial
knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for
fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate
vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also
offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering,
intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework,
it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward
a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent. The supplementary

Conclusion: SimLauncher为利用大规模仿真预训练优化真实世界RL提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a
longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement
learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in
real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world
faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and
significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a
safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,
while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated
using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a
novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and
real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we
first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,
which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values
using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived
from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from
the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive
experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation
tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly
improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope
this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on
leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic
RL.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Conclusion: VLM-TDP是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于复杂环境下的机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in
short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence
of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided
trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon
manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art
vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,
manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based
trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial
conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and
substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned
Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration
data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation
experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms
classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success
rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in
performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or
altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world
experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in
long-horizon tasks. Videos are available on https://youtu.be/g0T6h32OSC8

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine
systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial
navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed
respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these
filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match
handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this
paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right-
IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the
handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is
properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the
IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves
asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be
included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation
system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of
the two filters.

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction
and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless
switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount
challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive
Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and
human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across
multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of
collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework
overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically
restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and
transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive
model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and
robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By
employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted
features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns
multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent
estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our
framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of
HRC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂环境中表现不佳，固定视角摄像头易受视角变化影响，而3D点云技术多局限于关键帧预测，难以应对动态、接触密集的任务。

Method: PRISM包含三个主要组件：分割嵌入单元（分割点云并编码几何细节）、交叉注意力组件（融合视觉特征与机器人状态）、扩散模块（生成平滑动作）。

Result: 在每任务100次演示的训练下，PRISM在模拟环境中超越了2D和3D基线策略，表现出在复杂场景中的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRISM为机器人模仿学习提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D
perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed
camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point
cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing
their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly
learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need
for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main
components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud
into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a
cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed
robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that
translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on
100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies
in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating
strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are
available on https://github.com/czknuaa/PRISM.

*Tuan Dang,Manfred Huber*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人类空间感知的机器人导航方法，通过局部帧和全局拓扑图结合RRT*算法，解决了传统方法的高计算成本和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人导航方法存在高计算成本、全局地图不一致和泛化能力差的问题，本文受人类空间感知启发，提出新方法。

Method: 构建空间隐式局部帧模拟人类短期空间表示，整合到全局拓扑图中，并基于RRT*开发导航算法。

Result: 在真实数据集和实验室环境中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法在导航效率和泛化能力上优于传统方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to
operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional
approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps
simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ
human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to
navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high
computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to
unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans
perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.
Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent
essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are
hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,
so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit
local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.
Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring
Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the
topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab
environments. We open our source code at

TL;DR: DRAE是一种结合动态路由、检索增强生成和分层强化学习的新架构，显著提升了终身学习的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身学习中的灾难性遗忘和任务适应问题。

Method: 结合稀疏MoE门控机制、参数化检索增强（P-RAG）和分层强化学习框架（ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima）。

Result: 任务成功率82.5%，遗忘率极低，优于传统MoE模型。

Conclusion: DRAE为机器人提供了灵活、可扩展且高效的终身学习方案。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a
groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing
capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement
power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through
ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert
models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource
allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval
(P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with
ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning,
and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation
and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly
outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge
reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic
robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models.
Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable,
and efficient lifelong learning for robotics.

Abstract: We present MOSU, a novel autonomous long-range navigation system that
enhances global navigation for mobile robots through multimodal perception and
on-road scene understanding. MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation
challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to
ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS
map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal
trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory
generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for
precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for
traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social
context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments.
This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances
traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We
evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the
GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable
terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global
navigation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在增强强化学习效率和适应性方面具有潜力，并在实际应用中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved
performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual
comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation
without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of
domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high
computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we
propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent
framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes
in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to
establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before
each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to
update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to
generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery
capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks,
demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We
believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also
contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轨迹数据集在目标域中应用时的挑战，如域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本。

Method: IMMP采用两步法：预合并以捕获代理行为与交互，再合并构建适应目标域的模型。

Result: 在多种规划基准和模型上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP是一种高效且适应性强的运动规划方法。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Result: 实验表明，系统在不影响任务效率的情况下显著提高了操作安全性。

Conclusion: 该系统为杂乱环境中的遥操作提供了一种安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is
challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception
and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body,
obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local
robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation.
In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator
control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the
combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance.
Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile
manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger
visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are
integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during
teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our
system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task
efficiency.

Result: 渐近分析与数值模拟结果一致，揭示了对称解的分岔条件和稳定性转变。

Conclusion: 被动形状变量在非完整系统运动中能产生多稳态周期解，为机器人运动控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed
by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled
with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.
joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering
angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model
where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor
attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to
rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes
multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as
well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We
use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under
symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further
scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for
symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the
symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and
structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with
numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape
variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic
systems of robotic locomotion.

Conclusion: Piggyback Camera系统是一种高效、易部署的视觉监控方案，适用于商用机器人。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of
wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain.
Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the
demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade
stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors,
restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time
blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details
cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we
introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform
is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a
Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced,
achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade
detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate
brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests,
comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind
farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing
inspection autonomy.

Result: 实验证明TTTS在多种机器人任务中高效且能收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: TTTS是一种高效且通用的优化方法，适用于复杂的机器人任务。

Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal
control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems
involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and
long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art
optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying
scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to
achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration
across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However,
MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and
high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train
Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the
separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank,
linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation
time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the
bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across
inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion
planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of
TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.

limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset

between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging
the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often
involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements,
design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we
propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify
acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use
domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge
graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of
executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently
specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated
generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture
that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing
on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this
architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the
execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails
differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This
research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems,
contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: LERa是一种基于视觉语言模型的重新规划方法，通过视觉反馈解决机器人任务规划中的动态变化和失败问题，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在机器人任务规划中依赖文本输入，难以适应实时变化和失败，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: LERa通过三步流程（Look、Explain、Replan）利用视觉反馈进行重新规划，仅需原始RGB图像、自然语言指令、初始任务计划和失败检测。

Result: 在ALFRED-ChaOS和VirtualHome-ChaOS数据集上，LERa在动态环境中比基线方法提升40%性能；在PyBullet模拟器中，任务成功率提升高达67%。

Conclusion: LERa是一种鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，适用于机器人任务执行中的错误感知和重新规划。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning,
but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world
changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,
Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that
utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB
image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure
detection - without additional information such as object detection or
predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The
replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a
scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides
corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.
LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from
both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the
newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%
improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation
tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet
simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,
including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统缺乏人类驾驶员常用的全局导航信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出NavigScene数据集，开发三种导航引导范式：导航引导推理、导航引导偏好优化、导航引导视觉-语言-动作模型。

Result: 实验表明方法显著提升感知、预测、规划和问答任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动驾驶系统在复杂环境中的可靠导航迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.
