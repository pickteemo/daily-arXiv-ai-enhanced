Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical\nchallenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and\ndistribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based\ncomposite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon\ntasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds."}

In this work, we propose a structured\nreward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and\ncontrol Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning.

These planners define desired end-effector and joint\ntrajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize\ntracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides\nmeaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a\nreference is available.

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors.

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior.

This paper introduces the Generalized\nBehavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed\nto solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from\nhuman motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an\nadaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically\nretarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our\nnovel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,\nhigh-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire\nframework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac\nLab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple\nconfiguration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training\npolicies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent\nperformance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first\npractical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid\ncontrollers."}

We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which\nthe reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique\nriver segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov\nDecision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which\nrefines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline\ncomputed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage\nestimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in\nnon-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on\npatchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and\ndata-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent\nvision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics\nEstimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM\nfor cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of\nsolving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.\nSimulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and\nsuperior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized\nAdvantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions\nthat enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,\nCADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the\nLagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during\ntraining, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard\naction overlay."}
