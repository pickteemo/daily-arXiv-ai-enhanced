This vision\nincludes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human\ncollaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional\nInteractive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the\nlanguage they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language\nmodels (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language\nunderstanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with\nrobots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.\n  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that\nwork closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better\ncollaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system\nwith a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts\nwith both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its\nexperiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three\nspecific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and\npresent a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally,\nwe discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an\noperational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an\nintegrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans."}

Our proposed\nframework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining\nlarge language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search.

Currently, the majority of\nresearch on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting\nclothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since\nthe armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing\ntask successfully.

These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval"}

This paper\nintroduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,\nadaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided\nactor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.\nIts key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action\nsub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.\nTraining occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers\nState, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is\nbuilt on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,\nScalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500\nunseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible\ninefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,\nthe system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring\nDashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This\nwork presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing\nhow context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and\nmeasurable human impact."}

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues\nsuch as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical\nbenchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By\ndynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework\nfundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the\nbenchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms\nof EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering\nwith algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to\ninject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can\nrapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and\nprecisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,\nEvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems\nthrough continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the\ncomplexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model\naccuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving\nthese evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to\nbypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect\nsolutions. We define this phenomenon as \"Pseudo Aha Moment\".
