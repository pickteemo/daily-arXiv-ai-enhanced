This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk\naligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth\ninterpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D\nellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this\nrepresentation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian\ndisks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance\nprior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we\npropose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal\nconsistency.

These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements.

The performance under different\ncognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and\nreasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets.

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI."}

Waslander"], "title": "OpenNav: Open-World Navigation with Multimodal Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong\ncommon-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation\nand planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in\nboth indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and\napplicability.

In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors\nwill result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and\nerror terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the\nrobot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial\nsignal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In\nthis work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework\nfor accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws\nand constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing\nan accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we\nshow accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN\nis a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used\nin any typical mobile robot application."}

The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse\nmanipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability\nand generalization.
