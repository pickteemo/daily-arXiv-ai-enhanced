### [1] [Noise-Enabled Goal Attainment in Crowded Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08100)
*Lucy Liu,Justin Werfel,Federico Toschi,L. Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟、理论和机器人实验，探讨噪声运动如何打破交通拥堵并优化群体目标达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在拥挤环境中，理解并控制交通流对机器人群体协调和基础设施设计至关重要。

Method: 结合模拟、理论和机器人实验，分析噪声水平对交通流的影响，并优化群体目标达成率。

Result: 超过临界噪声水平时，大拥堵不会持续；简单反应方案在中等密度下表现良好且计算高效。

Conclusion: 简单反应方案在现实问题中更具实用性和计算效率。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

### [2] [Imitation Learning for Obstacle Avoidance Using End-to-End CNN-Based Sensor Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08112)
*Lamiaa H. Zain,Hossam H. Ammar,Raafat E. Shalaby*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究设计并测试了两种自定义CNN，用于移动机器人的避障导航，通过传感器融合输出角速度作为转向指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人在已知和未知环境中的避障导航至关重要。

Method: 使用深度相机的彩色和深度图像作为输入，设计并训练两种CNN，通过传感器融合生成角速度输出。

Result: 在多样化环境中收集数据集，并通过多种评估指标比较两种网络的性能。

Conclusion: 研究明确了哪种网络更适合实际应用。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and
unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth
camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the
mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

### [3] [Making VLMs More Robot-Friendly: Self-Critical Distillation of Low-Level Procedural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08224)
*Chan Young Park,Jillian Fisher,Marius Memmel,Dipika Khullar,Andy Yun,Abhishek Gupta,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SelfReVision是一种轻量级、可扩展的自我改进框架，用于提升视觉语言模型在机器人程序规划中的表现，无需外部监督或教师模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人程序规划中表现良好，但缺乏低层次细节；视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽能提供更接地气的规划，但现有方法依赖昂贵的大模型或局限于模拟环境。

Method: SelfReVision通过自我批评、修订和验证的循环，利用链式思维提示和自我指导范式，使小型VLMs生成更高质量的、可执行的规划。

Result: 实验表明，SelfReVision不仅提升了基础VLMs的性能，还优于规模大100倍的模型，并在下游具体任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: SelfReVision为轻量级VLMs提供了一种高效的自我改进方法，显著提升了规划质量和执行效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

### [4] [CL3R: 3D Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Robotic Manipulation Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08262)
*Wenbo Cui,Chengyang Zhao,Yuhui Chen,Haoran Li,Zhizheng Zhang,Dongbin Zhao,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CL3R是一种新型3D预训练框架，通过结合空间感知和语义理解，提升机器人操作策略的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练的2D基础模型，但缺乏3D空间信息和对多视角的泛化能力，限制了机器人精细操作的效果。

Method: 采用点云掩码自编码器学习3D表示，并通过对比学习利用预训练2D模型的语义知识。统一坐标系并融合多视角点云以提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，CL3R在仿真和现实场景中均表现出色，显著提升了机器人操作的感知能力。

Conclusion: CL3R通过结合3D空间和语义信息，有效解决了机器人操作中的感知挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

### [5] [Learning Robust Motion Skills via Critical Adversarial Attacks for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08303)
*Yang Zhang,Zhanxiang Cao,Buqing Nie,Haoyang Li,Yue Gao*

Conclusion: 提出的对抗训练范式有效解决了仿真与现实间的鲁棒性差距，为人形机器人在真实环境中的高性能运动提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

### [6] [Joint Optimization-based Targetless Extrinsic Calibration for Multiple LiDARs and GNSS-Aided INS of Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08349)
*Junhui Wang,Yan Qiao,Chao Gao,Naiqi Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种无需外部目标或重叠视野的多LiDAR与GINS的外参标定方法，通过几何对应和运动一致性优化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能采矿环境中，多LiDAR与GINS的精确外参标定对传感器融合至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工目标或重叠视野，且平面运动导致可观测性问题。

Method: 基于GINS安装高度的观测模型约束不可观测参数，结合几何对应和运动一致性，开发联合优化框架。

Result: 模拟和真实数据集实验验证了方法的准确性、鲁棒性和适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于异构LiDAR配置，解决了平面运动下的标定问题。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

### [7] [Towards Robust Sensor-Fusion Ground SLAM: A Comprehensive Benchmark and A Resilient Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08364)
*Deteng Zhang,Junjie Zhang,Yan Sun,Tao Li,Hao Yin,Hongzhao Xie,Jie Yin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了M3DGR数据集和Ground-Fusion++框架，填补了SLAM算法在复杂环境下评估和自适应传感器融合的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLAM方法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在极端条件下鲁棒性不足，且缺乏标准化评估和多传感器自适应融合策略。

Method: 1. 提出M3DGR数据集，包含多种传感器退化场景；2. 评估40种SLAM系统；3. 开发Ground-Fusion++框架，融合多种传感器。

Result: M3DGR数据集和Ground-Fusion++框架显著提升了SLAM在复杂环境下的性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过数据集和框架的贡献，推动了SLAM在挑战性环境中的研究和应用。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

### [8] [Intelligent Control of Spacecraft Reaction Wheel Attitude Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08366)
*Ghaith El-Dalahmeh,Mohammad Reza Jabbarpour,Bao Quoc Vo,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的卫星姿态控制策略TD3-HD，结合TD3、HER和DWC，显著提升了卫星在故障条件下的适应性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统PD控制器和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）无法满足实时适应性和容错需求。

Method: 整合TD3、HER和DWC（称为TD3-HD），以增强稀疏奖励环境中的学习能力，并在反应轮故障时保持卫星稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于PD控制器和其他DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、容错的机载AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

### [9] [LiDAR, GNSS and IMU Sensor Alignment through Dynamic Time Warping to Construct 3D City Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08420)
*Haitian Wang,Hezam Albaqami,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Algamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合LiDAR、GNSS和IMU数据的统一框架，用于解决LiDAR 3D建图中的累积漂移问题，显著提升了全局对齐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR 3D建图在GNSS受限环境中存在累积漂移问题，导致全局错位。

Method: 结合动态时间规整（DTW）和扩展卡尔曼滤波（EKF）进行数据融合，使用NDT配准和位姿图优化构建局部地图，并通过GNSS约束锚点和重叠段精细配准确保全局一致性。

Result: 全局对齐误差从3.32米降至1.24米，提升61.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法及配套数据集为GNSS受限环境下的3D城市建图设立了新基准，支持智能城市规划等多种应用。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

### [10] [Robotic Calibration Based on Haptic Feedback Improves Sim-to-Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08572)
*Juraj Gavura,Michal Vavrecka,Igor Farkas,Connor Gade*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于触觉反馈校准的新方法，通过触摸屏获取真实环境中机器人末端执行器位置，显著减少定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仿真与现实中机器人末端执行器位置不一致的问题，尤其是在仅有仿真中末端执行器位置信息的情况下。

Method: 利用触摸屏收集机器人末端执行器在真实环境中的位置数据，基于线性变换和神经网络构建转换函数。

Result: 完全非线性神经网络模型表现最佳，显著减少了定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法通过触觉反馈校准有效解决了仿真到现实转移中的末端执行器位置不一致问题。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

### [11] [Multi-critic Learning for Whole-body End-effector Twist Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08656)
*Aravind Elanjimattathil Vijayan,Andrei Cramariuc,Mattia Risiglione,Christian Gehring,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于强化学习的框架，实现动态、速度感知的全身末端执行器控制，解决行走和手臂动作的冲突目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行走和手臂动作的目标存在冲突，现有方法难以直接控制末端执行器速度，导致轨迹执行困难。

Method: 采用多评论家演员架构解耦行走和操作的奖励信号，设计基于扭转的末端执行器任务公式。

Result: 在四足机器人上验证，控制器能同时行走和移动末端执行器，并表现出全身协同行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了任务冲突，实现了动态全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

### [12] [Learning human-to-robot handovers through 3D scene reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08726)
*Yuekun Wu,Yik Lung Pang,Andrea Cavallaro,Changjae Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建的方法H2RH-SGS，仅从RGB图像学习机器人交接策略，无需真实机器人训练或数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实图像数据学习机器人操作策略时的高成本问题，以及仿真与真实环境间的视觉域差距。

Method: 利用稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建人类-机器人交接场景，生成图像-动作对，并通过模拟相机姿态变化训练机器人策略。

Result: 在16种家庭物品上训练的策略可直接部署到真实环境中，实验证明了H2RH-SGS的有效性。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的高效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合表模式和多步推理，有效解决了表问答中的挑战，并展示了卓越性能。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [15] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态Stackelberg博弈框架，用于建模大型语言模型（LLM）越狱攻击中攻击者与防御者的交互，并提出了一个名为“紫色代理”的AI解决方案，结合对抗探索和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需要一种系统化的防御方法。

Method: 采用动态Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展博弈，提出“紫色代理”结合RRT算法进行对抗探索和防御。

Result: 紫色代理能主动模拟攻击轨迹并干预，防止有害输出，为分析对抗动态提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为缓解LLM越狱风险提供了系统化方法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Nash框架通过游戏理论模型研究LLM驱动的决策，关注有限理性下的推理均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论假设完全理性，而LLM-Nash框架旨在捕捉有限理性，研究推理过程对决策的影响。

Method: 模型在提示空间中定义均衡，通过LLM推理生成行为输出，分析认知约束和思维表达。

Result: 推理均衡与传统纳什均衡存在差异，为LLM系统的战略互动提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为研究有限理性下的战略互动提供了新工具，拓展了博弈论的应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Motivation: 研究智能体如何在探索世界的同时保持对环境的控制，结合认知理论和强化学习，探讨好奇心与能力之间的权衡。

Method: 比较两种模型驱动代理：基于手工状态抽象的Tabular代理和学习内部世界模型的Dreamer代理，分析其探索行为。

Result: Tabular代理显示好奇心和能力引导探索的不同模式，而Dreamer代理揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。

Conclusion: 研究形式化了适应性探索作为追求未知与可控之间的平衡，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Motivation: 现有QFL框架主要针对单模态系统，限制了其在现实多模态任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于量子纠缠的中间融合多模态QFL方法，并设计了MMA机制以隔离未训练的量子电路。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在IID和非IID数据分布下分别提高了6.84%和7.25%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态QFL的空白，并通过MMA机制提升了模型稳定性。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以改进计算系统中的创造性溯因推理。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主LLM代理的工具使用能力带来了新的安全风险，包括用户和工具两方面的威胁，需要统一的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感）和策略驱动决策模型，结合沙盒环境和细粒度奖励塑造。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐代理显著提升对威胁的抵抗能力，同时保持良性任务的高效性。

Conclusion: 安全与效能可协同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该模型通过数据优化和训练策略创新，成功填补了MLLMs在动态空间推理上的能力缺口。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Motivation: 手动获取伦理需求效率低且资源消耗大，导致其在需求获取过程中优先级较低。

Method: 在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理，根据系统描述提供伦理问题的批评和建议。

Result: 框架能捕捉大部分研究者通过访谈识别的伦理需求，并引入额外相关需求，但存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推动伦理需求在工程中的广泛应用，但仍需人类反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的鸿沟，实现更准确、可解释的推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率显著优于基线（最高提升40%），同时增强透明度和错误可追溯性。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了一种可信赖、系统化的推理方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念，结合分层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例），并使用四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。专家评估显示信息质量、推理和专业表达均有改善。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了罕见病患者的诊断周期，接近临床阈值（0.90）。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: LMM能够理解细粒度地图，提出将其整合到地理参考工作流程中的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计涉及复杂的迭代推理，现有大型语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性并生成可执行模型。研究旨在评估结构化多智能体系统是否能更有效地管理需求提取、功能分解和模拟代码生成。

Method: 研究引入了设计状态图（DSG），并通过九角色MAS和双角色2AS进行实验，比较了两种LLM（Llama 3.3 70B和DeepSeek R1 70B）在不同配置下的表现。

Result: MAS在细节生成上优于2AS，但需求覆盖率低（<20%）。代码兼容性在特定2AS设置下达到100%，但MAS平均低于50%。推理蒸馏模型能可靠标记工作流完成。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体协调提升了设计细节，但需求覆盖率和代码保真度仍需改进。推理蒸馏LLM提高了完成率，但整体表现仍有局限。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

Abstract: We present elsciRL, an open-source Python library to facilitate the
application of language solutions on reinforcement learning problems. We
demonstrate the potential of our software by extending the Language Adapter
with Self-Completing Instruction framework defined in (Osborne, 2024) with the
use of LLMs. Our approach can be re-applied to new applications with minimal
setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text
input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization
techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the
optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the
use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted
applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated
approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including
increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.
