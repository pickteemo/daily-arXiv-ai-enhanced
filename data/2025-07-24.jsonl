However,\nthe data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and\nprocesses from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts\n(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing\nmultimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and\nstakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the\ncradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI\nagents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom\ndata abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text\nand images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach\nreduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data\navailability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of\nexpert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to\ndirectly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with\nsimilar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop\nwith a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven\nmethod to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown\nmaterial to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar\nmaterials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,\nthis improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this\napproach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows."}

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches\noutperform the original (greedy) flex distribution."}

Traditionally,\nqueuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand\nand fixed capacity.

This manuscript introduces an\nanalytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging\nof autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the\nfirst time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the\nmulti-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed\nform formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue\nlength and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a\ncrash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential\ncollisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.\nFinally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly\nminimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision\nvariables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is\nformulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to\nfind the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset\nvalidate the derived effective discharge rate.

TDR\ncomprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of\ndriving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances\ndexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces\nintensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control\nrequires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a\nreconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable\njoints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through\na pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a\ncontinuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively\nactuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates\nthe inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex\ncoordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated\nand compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further\nrevealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and\nvalidation experiments have been conducted.

These tools are\nnot tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive\nto how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools.

Each session includes high-density point cloud maps, 360 deg\npanoramic images, and trajectory data. Projected lidar scans, derived from the\npoint cloud maps and modeled with sensor-accurate occlusions, are used to\nevaluate alignment accuracy against the ground truth using two Iterative\nClosest Point (ICP) variants: Point-to-Point and Point-to-Plane. Results show\nthat Point-to-Plane offers significantly more stable and accurate registration,\nparticularly in areas with sparse features or dense vegetation. This study\nprovides a structured dataset for evaluating short-term localization\nrobustness, a reproducible framework for analyzing scan-to-map alignment under\nnoise, and a comparative evaluation of ICP performance in evolving outdoor\nenvironments. Our analysis underscores how local geometry and environmental\nvariability affect localization success, offering insights for designing more\nresilient robotic systems."}

Robotic systems can improve and enrich the\nphysical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they\nunder-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In\nthis position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the\ntherapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength,\naccuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human\nInteraction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically\ninteract through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research\ngroups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual\ntherapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both\napproaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary\nteam-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting\nresearch that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated\nrehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a\ntechnological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of\nnatural human-human interaction."}

Among\nrecent methods, Kernel Sum of Squares (KernelSOS) appears as a powerful\nframework, leveraging the potential of sum of squares methods from the\npolynomial optimization community with the expressivity of kernel methods\nwidely used in machine learning. This paper applies the kernel sum of squares\nframework for solving control and estimation problems, which exhibit poor local\nminima. We demonstrate that KernelSOS performs well on a selection of problems\nfrom both domains. In particular, we show that KernelSOS is competitive with\nother sum of squares approaches on estimation problems, while being applicable\nto non-polynomial and non-parametric formulations. The sample-based nature of\nKernelSOS allows us to apply it to trajectory optimization problems with an\nintegrated simulator treated as a black box, both as a standalone method and as\na powerful initialization method for local solvers, facilitating the discovery\nof better solutions."}

Ellison"], "title": "Event Detection for Active Lower Limb Prosthesis", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate event detection is key to the successful design of semi-passive and\npowered prosthetics. Kinematically, the natural knee is complex, with\ntranslation and rotation components that have a substantial impact on gait\ncharacteristics. When simplified to a pin joint, some of this behaviour is\nlost. This study investigates the role of cruciate ligament stretch in event\ndetection. A bicondylar knee design was used, constrained by analogues of the\nanterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This offers the ability to\ncharacterize knee kinematics by the stretch of the ligaments. The ligament\nstretch was recorded using LVDTs parallel to the ligaments of the Russell knee\non a bent knee crutch. Which was used to capture data on a treadmill at 3\nspeeds. This study finds speed dependence within the stretch of the cruciate\nligaments, prominently around 5\\% and 80\\% of the gait cycle for the posterior\nand anterior. The cycle profile remains consistent with speed; therefore, other\nstatic events such as the turning point feature at around 90\\% and 95\\% of the\ncycle, for the posterior and anterior, respectively, could be used as a\npredictive precursor for initial contact. Likewise at 90\\% and 95\\%, another\npair of turning points that in this case could be used to predict foot flat.\nThis concludes that the use of a bicondylar knee design could improve the\ndetection of events during the gait cycle, and therefore could increase the\naccuracy of subsequent controllers for powered prosthetics."}

As\ntheir use becomes ever more pervasive in civilian applications, failure to\nensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental\npollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that\nmotion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory\nduring navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do\nnot inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to\npotential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we\npropose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic\nmotion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First,\nwe use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level\ncollision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level\nsafety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory\ntracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation\nenvironment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone."}

While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward\ncrop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction\nin prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the\nnumber of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks\nto maximize overall performance."}
