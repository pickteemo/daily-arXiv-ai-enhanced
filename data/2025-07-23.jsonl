However, the\ntheoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and\nexisting approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --\noften fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles\nthat hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of\nembedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent\nLearner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a\ndepth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon\nfailure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent\nLearner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do\nso.

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.

Each drone\nadjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by\ncommunicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A\nnovel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric\nsaturation function.

Traditional automated\ntranslation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which\noften lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models\npresent promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based\nimplementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the\neffectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a\nsecure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation\npipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in\ndeveloper acceleration."}

The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment\nfor training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and\nresource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper\nproposes two innovative tools.
