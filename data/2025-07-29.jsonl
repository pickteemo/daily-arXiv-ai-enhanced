We\nsystematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only\nreward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward\n(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization\nparadigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a\n91\\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,\nwhile GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning.

However, most current\nsystems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,\nrendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in\ndynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning.

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach\nin a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects\ninvolved in support relations.

To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness.
