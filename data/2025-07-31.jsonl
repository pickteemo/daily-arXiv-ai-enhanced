While soft everting robots have\nbeen widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move\nand deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous\nwork focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation\ncapabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads\nin hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under\ndebris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this\nwork, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy\nlarger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what\nobjects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.\nBuilding on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of\npayloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict\npayload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft\neverting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though\na series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and\nmovement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads\nin a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through\ncircular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry\nout discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m\nin length."}

A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended\nto incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade\nthrough the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately\ntracking undisturbed and disturbed soil.

This paper provides\na straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network\nessentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for\nalgorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with\nlogarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By\napplying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the\nfirst time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,\nand modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,\nmodality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and\nLKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and\ndeception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there\nare deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single\npopulation, can efficiently maintain diversity.

To ensure robust evaluation,\nwe constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical\nwebsite, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and\n62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large\nlanguage models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records\nin real-world data.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such\ncontext-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of\nthe ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination.

To address this\nissue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a\nnovel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data\ncollection phase to guide the representation learning in IL.
