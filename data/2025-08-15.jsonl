In the academic\nresearch on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in\nthe design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by\nresearchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart\nsystem, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot\ninterfaces in detail.

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions.

We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation.

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition."}

However, these models lack effective\nerror correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training\nparadigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training\nset as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable\ndata source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error\ntrajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate\nself-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data\nserve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our\nparadigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,\nuncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel\nbegins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance\nour monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE\nand RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success\nrates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%\nand 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments\ndemonstrate \\method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle\navoidance, and long instruction following."}

While most existing methods typically employ single-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL\nalgorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:\napplying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single\nhumanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for\nsingle humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an\nindependent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global\ncritic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates\ntraining convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming\nconventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances\nthe integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new\ninsights into efficient locomotion strategies."}

A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to\nquantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote\nrigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust\nin autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for\nidentifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks."}

Cross"], "title": "A Multimodal Neural Network for Recognizing Subjective Self-Disclosure Towards Social Robots", "comment": "Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent\n  Robots and Systems (IROS)", "summary": "Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social\ninteraction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition."}

Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific\nrequirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites\nand space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using\nthe Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital\nparameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment\nincorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'\nsuperiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)\ndemonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This\napproach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient\nalternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning."}
