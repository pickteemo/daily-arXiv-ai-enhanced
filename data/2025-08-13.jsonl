Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high\ndegree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,\nwhich makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical\nworkarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,\nneither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true\nrobotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising\ntrajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching\nmodel abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including\nconstraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of\nmotion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and\ncontrol methods is given, followed by implementation details including model\nabstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller.

Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables.

Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that\noffers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more\naccountable LLMs."}

While most existing\nresearch focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the\nmatched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before\nsubmitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as\nit enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the\nexperience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including\nover 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good\nperformance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high\nexplainability."}

In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout.
