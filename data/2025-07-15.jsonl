However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent."}

To tackle these challenges and determine\nthe most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines\ntwo Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models.

However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and\npropose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which\nare the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths.

Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned.

While\nprior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong\nperformance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative\nsampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation\nwithout significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL\nbenchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based\nplanning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves\nhigher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In\nparticular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\\times$ speedup\nin inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for\nhigh-performance, low-latency offline planning."}

Building upon very\nrecent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature\nOctopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its\npredecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from\nmultiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nmodule to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects\non-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld\ntactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile\nsensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with\nOctopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will\nshowcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile\ninputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5\nwill identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how\nto handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also\nplan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.\nWith live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress\nand limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in\nthis exciting field.

However, most existing lane-changing\nframeworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to\naccurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study\nproposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.\nFirst, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully\ncooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs\ninformed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust\nevaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during\nlane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate\ncooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered\nby minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the\npredictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and\ncontext-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment\nconducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.\nResults show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different\nHVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism\nsignificantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and\ncontributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions."}

However, current systems rely on\nproprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,\nresulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale\nacross platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to\nenable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized\nrepresentations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as\nKGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,\nmultimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as\nimages and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and\nknowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that\ncombines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the\nstructured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of\nsupporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates\nontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent\nmanner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,\nontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using\ndifferent modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and\neffectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and\nperform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance.

These systems\ntypically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based\ninteraction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to\ndriver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a\nmodular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large\nlanguage models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling\nto enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS\nsupports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing\nnatural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented\nin the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes\nconfirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and\nrevisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased\nlatency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated\ndialogue history.
