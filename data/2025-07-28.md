### [1] [Initial Steps in Integrating Large Reasoning and Action Models for Service Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18775)
*Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出结合大型推理模型（LRM）和大型动作模型（LAM）的框架，以解决服务组合中的语义推理和执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务组合在构建自适应智能系统中面临推理能力有限和执行机制脆弱的挑战。

Method: 提出集成LRM和LAM的架构框架，LRM负责语义推理，LAM负责动态执行。

Result: 该框架能够自动化服务组合，弥合意图与执行之间的差距。

Conclusion: LRM-LAM集成有望将服务组合转变为完全自动化、用户友好的过程。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

### [2] [Simulation-Driven Reinforcement Learning in Queuing Network Routing Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18795)
*Fatima Al-Ani,Molly Wang,Jevon Charles,Aaron Ong,Joshua Forday,Vinayak Modi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟驱动的强化学习框架（Dyna-DDPG），用于优化复杂排队网络中的路由决策，适用于制造和通信领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统排队方法在动态和不确定环境中表现不佳，因此需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient（DDPG）和Dyna-style规划（Dyna-DDPG），并开发了灵活的模拟环境。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能快速学习有效的路由策略，在干扰下保持鲁棒性，并能扩展到更大网络。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强的Dyna-DDPG和良好的软件工程实践，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

*Alex Noviello,Claas Beger,Jacob Groner,Kevin Ellis,Weinan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE框架通过模仿人脑的HPC-PFC交互机制，实现了系统性组合泛化，在SCAN基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在组合泛化中的核心挑战，借鉴人脑海马体与前额叶皮层的协作机制。

Method: 结合元训练的Transformer神经分解器和动态提取可重用模式的Schema引擎，实现迭代式组合操作。

Result: 在SCAN基准测试中达到>99%的准确率，仅需1.19M参数。

Conclusion: MIRAGE的系统性依赖于模式提取质量和迭代优化过程，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

### [4] [Success in Humanoid Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18883)
*Wuhao Wang,Zhiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次在部分可观测的Gymnasium Humanoid-v4环境中成功训练出稳定的人形机器人策略，性能接近全状态访问的先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在部分可观测条件下高维任务（如人形机器人运动）中策略学习的挑战。

Method: 提出一种新颖的历史编码器，处理固定长度的过去观察序列，并将其集成到标准无模型算法中。

Result: 学习到的策略仅使用原始状态的三分之一至三分之二，性能与全状态基线相当，并能适应机器人属性变化。

Conclusion: 历史编码器通过重建关键上下文信息，实现了在部分可观测条件下的鲁棒决策。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

### [5] [Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977)
*Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Kanak Mahadik,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Mohammad Rostami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对时序知识图谱（TKG）的增量训练框架，解决新实体和稀疏连接问题，结合模型无关的增强层和加权采样策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TKG完成模型假设训练时可访问整个图谱，忽略了图谱动态演化带来的挑战，如新知识的泛化和稀疏连接实体的处理。

Method: 结合模型无关的增强层（基于全局实体相似性）和加权采样策略（突出稀疏实体连接），可增强现有TKG完成方法。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，框架在整体链接预测、归纳链接预测及长尾实体处理上优于现有方法，MRR提升10%-15%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升TKG完成方法的鲁棒性，特别适用于增量训练场景。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

### [6] [Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089)
*Shuhao Li,Weidong Yang,Yue Cui,Xiaoxing Liu,Lingkai Meng,Lipeng Ma,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FRTI的任务，旨在通过有限的道路数据生成更详细的车道级交通信息，并设计了一个两阶段框架RoadDiff来解决该任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器类型和数量的限制以及跟踪算法的准确性不足，获取车道级交通数据成为数据驱动模型的关键瓶颈。

Method: 设计了RoadDiff框架，包括Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder和Lane Diffusion Module，利用有限的空间-时间依赖性和分布关系推断车道交通状态。

Result: 在六个不同道路条件的数据集上验证了RoadDiff模型的有效性。

Conclusion: RoadDiff为解决FRTI任务提供了高效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

### [7] [Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109)
*Noé Lallouet,Tristan Cazenave,Cyrille Enderli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pareto-NRPA是一种新的蒙特卡洛算法，用于离散搜索空间中的多目标优化问题，扩展了单目标优化的NRPA算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标优化问题，特别是离散搜索空间中的问题，扩展NRPA算法的应用范围。

Method: 使用一组策略并行探索解空间的不同区域，并在搜索的每个层级维护非支配前沿，策略更新基于Pareto前沿的多样性和隔离性。

Result: 在MO-TSPTW和神经架构搜索任务中表现优异，优于现有多目标进化算法。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA是NRPA算法在多目标优化中的首次成功扩展，具有竞争力和潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

TL;DR: OS-MAP是一个用于日常计算机自动化任务的基准测试，通过五级自动化分类和需求层次结构评估代理能力，揭示当前代理在高阶任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分反映任务异质性和用户需求，阻碍了代理能力的针对性开发和实际部署。

Method: OS-MAP设计了416个现实任务，基于五级自动化分类和需求层次结构，形成性能-泛化评估矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的代理在涉及感知、推理和协调的高阶任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理的研究和部署提供了结构化评估框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,
environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at

### [9] [PhysDrive: A Multimodal Remote Physiological Measurement Dataset for In-vehicle Driver Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19172)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysDrive是一个大规模多模态数据集，用于无接触车内生理监测，涵盖多种驾驶条件和生理信号，旨在推动驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程生理监测（RPM）数据集规模小、多样性不足，无法反映真实驾驶场景的复杂性，因此需要更全面的数据集来支持研究。

Method: PhysDrive收集了48名驾驶员的多模态数据，包括RGB、近红外摄像头、毫米波雷达数据，以及六种同步生理信号（ECG、BVP、呼吸、心率、呼吸率和血氧）。

Result: 数据集覆盖了多种自然驾驶条件，并通过信号处理和深度学习方法进行了全面评估，建立了多模态基准。

Conclusion: PhysDrive将成为多模态驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统研究的基础资源，并推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

### [10] [Faster Lifting for Ordered Domains with Predecessor Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19182)
*Kuncheng Zou,Jiahao Mai,Yonggang Zhang,Yuyi Wang,Ondřej Kuželka,Yuanhong Wang,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新算法，用于处理有序域上的前驱关系，显著提升了加权一阶模型计数（WFOMC）的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理前驱关系时效率低下，尤其是在涉及线性顺序公理时。

Method: 将前驱关系作为公理的原生部分，设计了一种新算法，支持直接处理前驱关系。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在提升前驱关系处理效率方面表现优异，速度提升了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 新算法为有序域上的前驱关系提供了高效解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

### [11] [Knowledge Grafting: A Mechanism for Optimizing AI Model Deployment in Resource-Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19261)
*Osama Almurshed,Ashish Kaushal,Asmail Muftah,Nitin Auluck,Omer Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出知识嫁接方法，优化资源受限环境下的AI模型，显著减小模型大小并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在资源受限环境中部署的挑战，避免性能与模型大小的权衡问题。

Method: 通过知识嫁接，将大模型（供体）的选定特征（接穗）转移到小模型（砧木）中。

Result: 模型大小减少88.54%，验证准确率提升至89.97%，测试准确率达90.45%。

Conclusion: 知识嫁接方法有效，适用于边缘计算场景，推动AI在资源受限环境中的应用。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

### [12] [Modeling Uncertainty: Constraint-Based Belief States in Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19263)
*Achille Morenville,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了在不完全信息游戏中，通过约束满足问题和信念传播两种方法表示隐藏棋子身份的信念，发现约束方法效果接近概率推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息游戏中代理需基于部分知识决策的问题，减少游戏特定推理逻辑的需求。

Method: 采用约束满足问题和信念传播两种方法表示信念，并在两种游戏中评估其效果。

Result: 约束方法与概率推断效果相近，代理性能差异微小。

Conclusion: 约束信念状态可能足以支持有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会模拟中的应用潜力与限制，提出结合传统建模方法的混合方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从计算社会科学视角分析LLMs在模拟人类认知和社会行为中的价值与问题。

Method: 分为三部分：1）评估LLMs的认知能力与局限；2）调研多智能体模拟框架中的应用；3）区分适用场景并提倡混合方法。

Result: LLMs在交互模拟中表现良好，但在解释性或预测性建模中存在挑战。

Conclusion: 建议将LLMs与传统基于规则的建模平台结合，以兼顾灵活性与透明度。

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Method: 设计了受重写算法启发的神经符号架构，实现了NRS和FastNRS两种模型，重点优化了内存效率、训练速度和推理时间。

Result: 在数学公式简化等任务中，模型显著优于Neural Data Router和GPT-4o等基线，甚至匹配或超越了OpenAI的最新推理模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在符号算法学习任务中表现出色，具有高效性和多任务学习能力。

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed

### [16] [Perpetua: Multi-Hypothesis Persistence Modeling for Semi-Static Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18808)
*Miguel Saavedra-Ruiz,Samer B. Nashed,Charlie Gauthier,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Perpetua是一种用于建模半静态特征动态的方法，结合先验知识、多假设跟踪和自适应预测，优于类似方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂动态环境中，机器人需要预测半静态特征的未来状态，但现有方法无法有效建模动态特征。

Method: 通过混合“持久性”和“涌现”滤波器，以贝叶斯框架建模特征消失或重现的概率。

Result: 实验表明，Perpetua在模拟和真实数据中表现更优，具有在线适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Perpetua为动态环境中的特征状态预测提供了一种高效、可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

*Trent Weiss,Madhur Behl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)的算法，用于高速自动驾驶赛车中的碰撞风险估计，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞风险估计方法在高速赛车中表现保守或过于简化，无法满足精确、实时的需求。

Method: GLR算法结合Gauss-Legendre积分和非齐次泊松过程，分两阶段估计碰撞风险，考虑车辆几何和轨迹不确定性。

Result: 在446个超车场景的实验中，GLR平均误差减少77%，性能优于其他五种先进方法，且运行频率达1000 Hz。

Conclusion: GLR算法在高速自动驾驶赛车中表现优异，且具有通用性，可扩展至其他运动规划场景。

Abstract: Overtaking in high-speed autonomous racing demands precise, real-time
estimation of collision risk; particularly in wheel-to-wheel scenarios where
safety margins are minimal. Existing methods for collision risk estimation
either rely on simplified geometric approximations, like bounding circles, or
perform Monte Carlo sampling which leads to overly conservative motion planning
behavior at racing speeds. We introduce the Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)
algorithm, a principled two-stage integration method that estimates collision
risk by combining Gauss-Legendre with a non-homogeneous Poisson process over
time. GLR produces accurate risk estimates that account for vehicle geometry
and trajectory uncertainty. In experiments across 446 overtaking scenarios in a
high-fidelity Formula One racing simulation, GLR outperforms five
state-of-the-art baselines achieving an average error reduction of 77% and
surpassing the next-best method by 52%, all while running at 1000 Hz. The
framework is general and applicable to broader motion planning contexts beyond
autonomous racing.

TL;DR: MetaMorph框架通过元建模方法分类机器人形态，解决了现有分类方法的局限性，为HRI研究提供了更全面的视觉特征比较工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人外观分类方法过于宽泛或局限于拟人化特征，无法全面分类所有机器人类型，限制了设计与交互效果的研究。

Method: 从IEEE Robots Guide中的222个机器人数据中提取特征，采用元建模方法构建MetaMorph框架。

Result: MetaMorph提供了机器人视觉特征的分类和比较方法，支持研究者探索设计与任务、场景的最优匹配。

Conclusion: MetaMorph为机器人外观设计及其对交互影响的研究提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Robot appearance crucially shapes Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) but is
typically described via broad categories like anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or
technical. More precise approaches focus almost exclusively on anthropomorphic
features, which fail to classify robots across all types, limiting the ability
to draw meaningful connections between robot design and its effect on
interaction. In response, we present MetaMorph, a comprehensive framework for
classifying robot morphology. Using a metamodeling approach, MetaMorph was
synthesized from 222 robots in the IEEE Robots Guide, offering a structured
method for comparing visual features. This model allows researchers to assess
the visual distances between robot models and explore optimal design traits
tailored to different tasks and contexts.

Conclusion: 三平面特征设计和可变形可操纵卷积有效提升抓取模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations
around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample
efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --
i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a
novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are
equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two
planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by
a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of
deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.
This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while
preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations
of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,
we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism
and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow
matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed
equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated
and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory
costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane
features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving
higher performance with only a modest computational overhead. Video and code

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种非迭代、解耦的6自由度机器人位姿估计方法，利用重叠平面特征，避免了传统RGB-D视觉里程计的迭代优化和特征匹配，计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB-D视觉里程计依赖迭代优化和特征匹配，计算负担重且耗时，尤其在低纹理退化环境中表现不佳。

Method: 通过分离旋转和平移估计，先利用场景中的平面特征计算旋转矩阵，再用核互相关器（KCC）确定平移，避免迭代优化和特征提取。

Result: 在低端i5 CPU上实现71Hz的性能，在低纹理退化环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了计算效率和性能，适用于资源受限和复杂环境下的机器人位姿估计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for efficiently estimating the
6-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robot pose with a decoupled, non-iterative method
that capitalizes on overlapping planar elements. Conventional RGB-D visual
odometry(RGBD-VO) often relies on iterative optimization solvers to estimate
pose and involves a process of feature extraction and matching. This results in
significant computational burden and time delays. To address this, our
innovative method for RGBD-VO separates the estimation of rotation and
translation. Initially, we exploit the overlaid planar characteristics within
the scene to calculate the rotation matrix. Following this, we utilize a kernel
cross-correlator (KCC) to ascertain the translation. By sidestepping the
resource-intensive iterative optimization and feature extraction and alignment
procedures, our methodology offers improved computational efficacy, achieving a
performance of 71Hz on a lower-end i5 CPU. When the RGBD-VO does not rely on
feature points, our technique exhibits enhanced performance in low-texture
degenerative environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in robot autonomy and safety has significantly improved
human-robot interactions, enabling robots to work alongside humans on various
tasks. However, complex assembly tasks still present significant challenges due
to inherent task variability and the need for precise operations. This work
explores deploying robots in an assistive role for such tasks, where the robot
assists by fetching parts while the skilled worker provides high-level guidance
and performs the assembly. We introduce GEAR, a gaze-enabled system designed to
enhance human-robot collaboration by allowing robots to respond to the user's
gaze. We evaluate GEAR against a touch-based interface where users interact
with the robot through a touchscreen. The experimental study involved 30
participants working on two distinct assembly scenarios of varying complexity.
Results demonstrated that GEAR enabled participants to accomplish the assembly
with reduced physical demand and effort compared to the touchscreen interface,
especially for complex tasks, maintaining great performance, and receiving
objects effectively. Participants also reported enhanced user experience while
performing assembly tasks. Project page: sites.google.com/view/gear-hri

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性关节机器人的运动控制受关节弹性和系统参数变化的限制，传统DOB设计保守，性能受限。

Method: 采用FRF优化方法，最大化控制带宽并抑制振动，同时通过Nyquist稳定性准则证明闭环稳定性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提升了系统的鲁棒性和运动性能，尤其在关节弹性和系统变化条件下。

Conclusion: 提出的FRF优化方法有效解决了柔性关节机器人DOB设计的保守性问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Motion control of flexible joint robots (FJR) is challenged by inherent
flexibility and configuration-dependent variations in system dynamics. While
disturbance observers (DOB) can enhance system robustness, their performance is
often limited by the elasticity of the joints and the variations in system
parameters, which leads to a conservative design of the DOB. This paper
presents a novel frequency response function (FRF)-based optimization method
aimed at improving DOB performance, even in the presence of flexibility and
system variability. The proposed method maximizes control bandwidth and
effectively suppresses vibrations, thus enhancing overall system performance.
Closed-loop stability is rigorously proven using the Nyquist stability
criterion. Experimental validation on a FJR demonstrates that the proposed
approach significantly improves robustness and motion performance, even under
conditions of joint flexibility and system variation.

Abstract: High-precision navigation and positioning systems are critical for
applications in autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping, where robust and
continuous localization is essential. To test and enhance the performance of
algorithms, some research institutions and companies have successively
constructed and publicly released datasets. However, existing datasets still
suffer from limitations in sensor diversity and environmental coverage. To
address these shortcomings and advance development in related fields, the
SmartPNT Multisource Integrated Navigation, Positioning, and Attitude Dataset
has been developed. This dataset integrates data from multiple sensors,
including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU), optical cameras, and LiDAR, to provide a rich and versatile
resource for research in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation. The
dataset construction process is thoroughly documented, encompassing sensor
configurations, coordinate system definitions, and calibration procedures for
both cameras and LiDAR. A standardized framework for data collection and
processing ensures consistency and scalability, enabling large-scale analysis.
Validation using state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms, such as VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, demonstrates the dataset's
applicability for advanced navigation research. Covering a wide range of
real-world scenarios, including urban areas, campuses, tunnels, and suburban
environments, the dataset offers a valuable tool for advancing navigation
technologies and addressing challenges in complex environments. By providing a
publicly accessible, high-quality dataset, this work aims to bridge gaps in
sensor diversity, data accessibility, and environmental representation,
fostering further innovation in the field.

Abstract: This study explores which factors of the visual design of a robot may
influence how humans would place it in a collaborative cooking scenario and how
these features may influence task delegation. Human participants were placed in
a Virtual Reality (VR) environment and asked to set up a kitchen for cooking
alongside a robot companion while considering the robot's morphology. We
collected multimodal data for the arrangements created by the participants,
transcripts of their think-aloud as they were performing the task, and
transcripts of their answers to structured post-task questionnaires. Based on
analyzing this data, we formulate several hypotheses: humans prefer to
collaborate with biomorphic robots; human beliefs about the sensory
capabilities of robots are less influenced by the morphology of the robot than
beliefs about action capabilities; and humans will implement fewer avoidance
strategies when sharing space with gracile robots. We intend to verify these
hypotheses in follow-up studies.

Abstract: Localization of mobile robots is crucial for deploying robots in real-world
applications such as search and rescue missions. This work aims to develop an
accurate localization system applicable to swarm robots equipped only with
low-cost monocular vision sensors and visual markers. The system is designed to
operate in fully open spaces, without landmarks or support from positioning
infrastructures. To achieve this, we propose a localization method based on
equilateral triangular formations. By leveraging the geometric properties of
equilateral triangles, the accurate two-dimensional position of each
participating robot is estimated using one-dimensional lateral distance
information between robots, which can be reliably and accurately obtained with
a low-cost monocular vision sensor. Experimental and simulation results
demonstrate that, as travel time increases, the positioning error of the
proposed method becomes significantly smaller than that of a conventional
dead-reckoning system, another low-cost localization approach applicable to
open environments.

Conclusion: 自动课程学习框架有效提升了自动驾驶策略的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating complex real-world traffic,
requiring safe handling of both common and critical scenarios. Reinforcement
learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to
learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies
on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current
scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a
balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which
progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising
approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.
However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,
focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.
This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum
learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively
generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive
mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring
exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though
exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability,
reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's
ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with
automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic,
achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.

Method: ReCoDe通过局部通信学习动态约束，改进专家控制器，实现更有效的协调。

Result: 在复杂导航任务中，ReCoDe优于纯手工控制器、其他混合方法及标准MARL基线。

Conclusion: 保留用户定义控制器并动态调整其依赖程度，比从头学习更高效。

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

Result: 视觉语言模型能够为自主社交机器人提供足够通用的多模态处理能力。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型是提升社交机器人多模态交互能力的有效途径，但仍需解决技术挑战。

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

Abstract: This study presents a grasping method for objects with uneven mass
distribution by leveraging diffusion models to localize the center of gravity
(CoG) on unknown objects. In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to
postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven
methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring
unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A
vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve
CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios
demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to
conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over
state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong
generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects,
providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.
