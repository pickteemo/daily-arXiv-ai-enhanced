Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,\nrequires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,\nespecially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable\nand dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on\npredefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.\nTo address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map\nto evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we\nintroduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning\n(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and\nUAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between\nthe representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse\ndata sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to\nbalance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time\npath planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach\nenables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and\nenhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety."}

DiffPF\nlearns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on\npredicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate,\nequally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal\nfiltering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios,\nincluding both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on\nsimulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms\nexisting filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8%\nimprovement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization\nbenchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry\nbenchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of\nour knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion\nmodels into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that\nproduces more informative particles and significantly improves state\nestimation."}

Performance was assessed\nacross 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and\nGPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance\nand correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using\nGPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times.

A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation.
