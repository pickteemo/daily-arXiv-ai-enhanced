In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,\nwe find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also\nbeing online adaptable and robust to missing observations."}

Previous work has\nexplored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),\nwhich computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic\nsentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically\nencoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the\nsentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and\nsecond predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.\nAlthough WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing\nalgorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the\npredecessor relations are involved.
