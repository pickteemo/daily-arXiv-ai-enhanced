Discussions of whether or how to integrate\nlarge language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,\nor interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of\nhow these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's\nalignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of\nLLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we\nelicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images\nthat were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that\nwhen performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human\nparticipants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or\nhigher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between\nhuman and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall\nLLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,\ndisgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)\norganization.

Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of\nthese systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned\nin one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different\nphysical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,\nas their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a\ndomain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative\nadversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain\nto a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to\nadapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a\ndomain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure\nsignals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in\nboth domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments\nacross five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise\nperturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP\neffectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more\nadaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers."}

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.
