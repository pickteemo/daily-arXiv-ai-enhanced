This paper presents\nan integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for\nprescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to\nprovide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP\nframework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that\ncombines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for\nintelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration\ndata (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM\nprocessing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system\nclassifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and\nassesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications.

The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot.

We present optimal\nplanning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic\nmerging regulation (HCMR).

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms."}

Fires are\nanother important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that\noccur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have\nincreased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety\nmonitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system\nintegrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,\ndesigned to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot\nworkers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE\ncompliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making\ndriven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless\nintegration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM\nrecommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential\nfire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible\nwarnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging\nplatforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel.

Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our\nframework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA\nand BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement\nto human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,\nrespectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior.

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms."}
