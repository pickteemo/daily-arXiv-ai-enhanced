SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines.

The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state\nresets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on\nnonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a\npractical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy\noptimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor\nstate space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware\nexperiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose\nartificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more\nquickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that\nM-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and\nachieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car.

Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the\ncomplicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement\nlearning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic\ndecisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language\nmodel-based commander to address the issue of intelligent\nperception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method\nintegrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight\nlarge language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and\ndecision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and\ninterpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,\nthe combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting\nthe cognitive process of human commanders.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems."}
