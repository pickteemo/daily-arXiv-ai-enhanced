However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u2019\uff0c\u5373\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002MLLMs\u56e0\u5176\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SGV\u4f7fMLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd548%\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In particular, honeybees mainly\nuse the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their\nvisual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a\nReinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only\noptic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained\nagents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base\ntheir motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most\nattention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with\nlarge optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

Our\nExperimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,\ngeneral-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these\ntasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an\n18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy.

Simoni"], "title": "Robust Route Planning for Sidewalk Delivery Robots", "comment": null, "summary": "Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight\ndistribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,\nhigher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on\nsidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure\nconditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions.

While game-theoretic methods\nare widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent\ninteractions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating\nthe intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional\nuncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing\ngame-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive\ntrajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties\nof agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.\nAs the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under\nintentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its\nagent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain\nminor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive\ntrajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium\ncan be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we\npresent a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the\nproblem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant\noutcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nis effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of\nintentional uncertainties.

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LiDAR\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08LGL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5UniLGL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5b8c\u6574\u70b9\u4e91\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002UniLGL\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6BEV\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eUniLGL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLGL\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

By interleaving the creation of regrasp\nmaps, their adaptation based on failed refinements, and solving TAMP\n(sub)problems, we are able to provide a robust search method for challenging\nregrasp manipulation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u7684TAMP\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6293\u53d6\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u672a\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff08\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u5730\u56fe\uff09\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u731c\u6d4b\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u653e\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u8d25\u8c03\u6574\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u89e3\u51b3TAMP\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u6293\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Designed for precision, repeatability, and safety, ACAT addresses\nthe limitations of manual contact angle testing by combining programmable\nrobotics, precise liquid dispensing, and a modular software-hardware\narchitecture. The system is composed of three core subsystems: (1) an\nelectrical system including power, control, and safety circuits compliant with\nindustrial standards such as NEC 70, NFPA 79, and UL 508A; (2) a software\ncontrol system based on a Raspberry Pi and Python, featuring fault detection,\nGPIO logic, and operator interfaces; and (3) a mechanical system that includes\na 3-axis Cartesian robot, pneumatic actuation, and a precision liquid dispenser\nenclosed within a safety-certified frame. The ACAT enables high-throughput,\nautomated surface characterization and provides a robust platform for future\nintegration into smart manufacturing and materials discovery workflows.
