When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In\nthese experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects\nassumed to be static and placed on the table.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1.

To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL).

While object-centric flow\nprediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios\ninvolving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this\nwork, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly\nlearns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting\nembodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's\ninherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile\nmanipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and\nnon-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language\ninstructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment\nmodule by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.\nMoreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a\nstandard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify\nkinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We\nvalidate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,\ndemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%\nimprovement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and\nnon-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art\nobject-centric flow methods.
