Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a\npreliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an\nexponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures\nare needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.\nTherefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of\nthe grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning\nprocess.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods.

To support LMs while ensuring\nreal-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,\nwhich leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to\nembodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral\nefficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user\ninterference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which\nleverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an\nideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,\nresulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm.

However,\nmost existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new\nenvironments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability\ndiminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.\nIn this paper, we break away from the conventional \"train once, deploy forever\"\nparadigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous\ndriving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoPSF\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvoPSF\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u548c\u635f\u574f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoPSF\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view\nand 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,\nodometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial\nmeasurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate\ntimestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and\noffline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale\nsequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,\nand indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.\nHigh-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is\nderived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a\nnavigation-grade IMU.

It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to\n(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)\nto dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray\nnozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not\npossible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying\nand the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In\naddition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,\nboom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of\nthis complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.\nTherefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed\nsimpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.\nThe comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is\nintrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.\nCombinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as\nthree sections-setups are compared.

The agricultural\nenvironment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and\nocclusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring\nprecise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and\nmodeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly\nidentifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely\ninertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile\nsensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp\nstates. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the\nperformance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest\nclassifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry\ntomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and\nsuccessful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.\nFurthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and\ntension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier\nenables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby\nenhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u6293\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u679c\u91c7\u6458\u3002", "motivation": "\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u5f97\u6293\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86IMU\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u5f20\u529b\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548cRGB\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6a31\u6843\u756a\u8304\u690d\u682a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "IMU\u548c\u5f20\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u6293\u53d6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6458\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}
