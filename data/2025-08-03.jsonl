This unifies existing post-hoc explainability\nalgorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce.

This is especially important\nfor localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp\nsurfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we\nfirst construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact\nand robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms.

These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade\ntracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a\nsubject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that\nuses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to\nestimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our\nmethod improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with\nvarying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically\ntune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more\naccurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results\nfrom seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking\nerrors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative\nvisualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in\nmotion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs\nwith closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for\nhigh-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications."}
