### [1] [Strongly Solving $7 \times 6$ Connect-Four on Consumer Grade Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05267)
*Markus Böck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，成功生成了一个89.6 GB的查找表，解决了标准7×6棋盘大小的Connect-Four游戏的强解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Connect-Four游戏已通过数学方法解决，但生成查找表形式的强解被认为不可行。本文旨在探索一种高效的符号搜索方法来实现这一目标。

Method: 采用基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，结合高效的实现，生成了一个大型查找表。此外，还集成了alpha-beta搜索以优化最快胜利或最慢失败的策略。

Result: 在单核CPU和128 GB内存的条件下，47小时内生成了一个89.6 GB的查找表，覆盖了标准7×6棋盘大小的所有可能情况。

Conclusion: 本文证明了通过符号搜索方法可以高效生成Connect-Four游戏的强解查找表，为类似问题提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

### [2] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户对交通信号控制计划的半结构化描述转换为精确的信号相位与时间（SPaT）结果，准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定时交通信号控制计划需要大量手动输入，效率低下且容易出错，Chat2SPaT旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 通过LLMs理解用户描述并生成JSON格式的相位序列和属性，再通过Python脚本处理细节并组装完整计划。

Result: 实验表明，Chat2SPaT在300多个测试案例中准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通信号控制计划管理提供了高效且用户友好的解决方案，并展示了LLMs在智能交通系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean.

### [4] [OLG++: A Semantic Extension of Obligation Logic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05488)
*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jon Stephens,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OLG++是Obligation Logic Graph（OLG）的语义扩展，用于建模市政和跨辖区背景下的法规和法律规则，支持更丰富的节点和边类型，提升法律知识表示的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律知识表示模型（如LegalRuleML）在空间约束、子类关系和异常结构等方面支持不足，OLG++旨在填补这一空白。

Method: OLG++引入空间、时间、群体、可废止性和逻辑分组等新节点和边类型，支持结构化推理和复杂触发条件。

Result: 通过食品业务法规的案例验证，OLG++在表达能力和法律问答方面优于现有图模型。

Conclusion: OLG++为法律知识表示提供了更丰富的语义支持，尤其在跨辖区和复杂规则场景中表现突出。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

### [5] [Deep Research Comparator: A Platform For Fine-grained Human Annotations of Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05495)
*Prahaladh Chandrahasan,Jiahe Jin,Zhihan Zhang,Tevin Wang,Andy Tang,Lucy Mo,Morteza Ziyadi,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Zimeng Qiu,Markus Dreyer,Akari Asai,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Deep Research Comparator平台，用于评估深度研究代理的生成报告和中间步骤，并提供详细反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决评估自主网络搜索、信息分析和报告生成的深度研究代理的挑战，尤其是对长报告和中间步骤的详细反馈需求。

Method: 开发了Deep Research Comparator平台，支持代理报告对比、细粒度反馈收集和排名计算；同时提出Simple Deepresearch作为基线代理框架。

Result: 收集了17位标注者对三个深度研究代理的真实偏好数据，验证了平台的有效性。

Conclusion: 该平台为深度研究代理的开发提供了实用工具，支持报告对比和反馈收集。

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4d2dnbdseg.

*Haochen Huang,Jiahuan Pei,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Xin Sun,Moonisa Ahsan,Pablo Cesar,Chuang Yu,Zhaochun Ren,Junxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对AR训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）数据集，评估了9种先进模型，发现其在细粒度任务中表现不佳，呼吁改进数据集和基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在AR训练中的应用，填补研究空白，并为盲人和视障用户提供平等的AI学习机会。

Method: 构建了一个系统化的AR训练数据集，并评估了9种先进VLM的性能。

Result: 即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在细粒度任务中表现不佳，最高F1分数仅为40.54%。

Conclusion: 需改进数据集和基准以提升视觉语言对齐能力，研究对盲人和视障用户具有社会意义。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用ASP的特性实现义务模态逻辑，并解决其经典悖论问题。

Method: 通过ASP的全局约束表示义务和禁止，结合默认否定和强否定来表达模态算子。

Result: 提出的方法能够优雅地解决义务模态逻辑中的多种悖论。

Conclusion: ASP为义务模态逻辑的实现提供了有效且优雅的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how
(deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation
(negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming
(ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and
impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed
representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being
elegantly resolved.

### [8] [Cultivating Multimodal Intelligence: Interpretive Reasoning and Agentic RAG Approaches to Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520)
*Karishma Thakrar,Shreyas Basavatia,Akshay Daftardar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC挑战赛聚焦多模态皮肤病问答与分割，提出结合微调模型、结构化推理层和代理RAG的方法，在竞赛中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远程医疗中诊断决策的高准确性和可解释性需求，模拟皮肤科医生的系统性推理模式。

Method: 结合微调开源多模态模型、结构化推理层和代理RAG，填补患者背景信息。

Result: 竞赛中取得第二名，展示高准确性和竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化诊断支持系统提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners,
bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails
to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for
assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a
multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning
conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction
manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess
pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner
conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics.
Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with
human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in
diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our
datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

### [10] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文批判性地审视了AI红队测试的实践，指出其当前在AI治理中的局限性，并提出一个涵盖宏观系统层面和微观模型层面的综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI红队测试在AI治理中日益流行，但其过于关注模型层面的缺陷，而忽视了更广泛的社会技术系统和涌现行为。本文旨在填补这一理论与实践之间的差距。

Method: 提出一个两层次的框架：宏观系统红队测试（覆盖整个AI开发生命周期）和微观模型红队测试，并结合网络安全经验和系统理论提出建议。

Result: 强调有效的AI红队测试需要多学科团队，以研究涌现风险、系统性漏洞及技术与社会因素的相互作用。

Conclusion: AI红队测试需要超越模型层面的局限，采用更全面的视角，以确保AI系统的整体安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用GPT-4o-mini生成反事实解释（CFs）的方法，在零样本和三样本设置下表现优异，优于传统方法，并能提升下游分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实解释（CFs）能提供人类可理解的机器学习预测解释，用于异常预防和增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini生成CFs，在AI-Readi和心脏病检测数据集上评估，与传统方法（DiCE、CFNOW、NICE）对比。

Result: LLM生成的CFs在合理性（99%）、有效性（0.99）和稀疏性上表现优异，且作为增强数据能提升分类器准确率5%。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA通过将低秩适应重新表述为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，解决了LoRA中的尺度冲突问题，提升了训练稳定性并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中表现出色，但矩阵间的尺度差异导致训练不稳定和性能下降。SingLoRA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SingLoRA将权重更新分解为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，消除了尺度冲突，并减少了参数数量。

Result: 在多个任务中验证了SingLoRA的优势，如在LLama 7B微调中准确率超过LoRA和LoRA+，同时参数更少；在Stable Diffusion微调中图像保真度更高。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简化设计解决了LoRA的稳定性问题，并在性能和参数效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Conclusion: 通过正式测量理论，AI研究与实践可实现更透明、可比较的评估体系。

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Result: 在CMDC和E-DAIC-WOZ数据集上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MLlm-DR在多模态抑郁症诊断中表现出高效性和优越性，为临床实践提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力的扩散模型（ADMC），用于解决多模态情感和意图识别中缺失模态的问题，避免了传统方法的过耦合和不精确生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感和意图识别中，传感器故障或数据不完整导致模态缺失，传统方法在重建缺失信息时存在过耦合和不精确的问题。

Method: 独立训练每个模态的特征提取网络，使用注意力扩散网络（ADN）生成与真实多模态分布一致的缺失模态特征。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，适用于缺失和完整模态场景。

Conclusion: ADMC框架在多模态情感和意图识别中表现出色，尤其在处理缺失模态时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究表明，由大型语言模型（LLM）生成的检索练习问题能显著提高学生的知识保留率，但需人工验证其质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师生成高质量检索练习问题耗时耗力的问题，探索LLM自动生成问题的有效性。

Method: 通过两门大学数据科学课程的实证研究，比较学生使用LLM生成的多选题与无练习时的学习效果。

Result: 使用LLM生成问题的学生知识保留率显著提高（89% vs 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习问题可有效支持学习，但需人工验证以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI和社交媒体中信息传播的复杂性，提出了一种基于情感记忆的SIP-CoT机制，以提升LLM代理的社会智能和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如SIR）和现有高级方法（如注意力机制和图神经网络）未能充分捕捉在线互动的复杂性，尤其是用户心理和行为动态。LLM的潜力未被完全开发以模拟信息传播的心理层面。

Method: 提出SIP-CoT机制，结合情感记忆，优化LLM代理对社交线索的解释、目标个性化和反馈评估。

Result: 实验证明，SIP-CoT增强的LLM代理能更有效地处理社交信息，行为、态度和情感更接近真实人类互动。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM模拟的局限性，并展示了SIP-CoT和情感记忆如何显著提升LLM代理的社会智能和真实性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于司法数据的城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测方法（TLJD），通过整合大规模司法数据解决传统经济数据易被操纵的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FDI预测依赖经济数据（如GDP），但这些数据可能被操纵，导致预测不可靠。司法数据能反映投资安全和回报，因此被用于改进预测。

Method: 构建了基于1200万份公开裁判文书的司法绩效评估指标体系，提出TLJD方法，整合行数据和列数据，并利用专家混合模型调整指标权重。

Result: 在跨城市和跨时间任务中，TLJD表现优于10种基线方法（R2至少达到0.92）。

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据有效提升了FDI预测的可靠性，为地方政府提供了更准确的决策支持。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类专家与两种AI模型（通用型和推理型）生成的皮肤病治疗方案，发现评估结果因评估者（人类或AI）而异，揭示了临床经验与算法逻辑之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在医疗领域的扩展，评估其生成的治疗方案质量成为关键挑战，尤其是在新的推理模型出现后。

Method: 十名皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）为五个复杂皮肤病案例生成治疗方案，匿名后由人类专家和高级AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）分别评分。

Result: 人类专家评分显著高于AI方案，而AI评委则完全相反，评分AI方案更高。推理AI（o3）在AI评委中排名第一，但在人类评分中表现较差。

Conclusion: 治疗方案的质量感知取决于评估者性质，未来需开发可解释的人机协同系统以弥合临床经验与算法逻辑的差距。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

TL;DR: ModelAuditor是一个自省代理，通过对话、选择任务指标和模拟临床相关的分布变化，生成可解释的报告，帮助识别和修复AI模型在临床实践中的潜在失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在临床实践中可能因现实世界的变化（如硬件、光照或人口统计的微小变化）而失效，但目前缺乏高效且易用的工具来审计和修复这些失败模式。

Method: ModelAuditor通过多智能体架构，模拟临床相关的分布变化，生成报告解释性能下降的原因，并提供缓解策略。

Result: 在三个真实临床场景中，ModelAuditor成功识别了失败模式，并通过针对性建议恢复了15-25%的性能损失，优于基准模型和最先进的增强方法。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，帮助提高AI模型在临床实践中的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微电网中电池SoH的实时监测面临挑战，传统方法受限。

Method: 通过分析充电结束阶段的放电脉冲，利用等效电路模型参数估计SoH。

Result: 实验数据验证了方法的有效性，预测误差约1%，解释性得分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统（BMS）中，优化持续运行下的电池管理。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI代理在任务规划和视觉定位中的模糊性和复杂性挑战。

Method: 引入测试时扩展方法选择最佳动作提案，并利用强化学习模型提高视觉定位准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，如Screenspot-Pro（50.1%）、Screenspot-V2（92.4%）和OSWorld-G（67.7%）。

Conclusion: GTA1通过测试时扩展和强化学习显著提升GUI代理性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在预测早产儿视网膜病变（ROP）风险中的能力，提出了CROP数据集和Affective-ROPTester评估框架，发现外部知识增强和情感提示对模型性能及偏见有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补研究空白，并研究情感提示对模型偏见的影响。

Method: 使用CROP数据集（993条记录），提出Affective-ROPTester框架，结合指令、思维链和上下文学习三种提示策略，并融入情感元素。

Result: LLM仅依赖内部知识时预测效果有限，外部知识显著提升性能；模型存在情感偏见，积极情感提示有助于减少偏见。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester为临床语言模型评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Conclusion: 该计算模型可通过逻辑编程语言实现，为神经符号自动推理工具提供理论基础。

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter

Motivation: 现有音乐描述模型仅关注音乐元素，无法生成与音乐情感匹配的场景描述。本文旨在通过跨模态训练，实现音乐与场景的关联想象。

Method: 1. 构建包含3,371对视频-音频描述的大规模数据集；2. 微调Music Understanding LLaMA（MU-LLaMA）以创建MusiScene；3. 通过全面评估验证模型性能。

Conclusion: MusiScene通过跨模态学习实现了音乐场景想象，为音乐理解和生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from

Result: 在3B参数规模下，模型在多模态和纯文本任务中表现优异，数据效率高。

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为高性能边缘设备MLLM的发展提供了重要贡献和研究启示。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型为无线网络中的多任务预测提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于属性的方法，提升可解释AI在乳腺癌淋巴水肿风险评估中的透明度和可接受性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的AI技术缺乏透明度，限制了其在医疗决策中的可解释性和接受度。

Method: 通过信息检索技术的标准指标，对基于规则的预测模型中的属性进行统计分析，计算每个属性对预测的相关性。

Result: 用户研究表明，该方法生成的输出比原始可解释AI模型的输出更具可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升AI预测在医疗决策中的透明度和可接受性。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

TL;DR: HopeBot是一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人，用于抑郁症筛查，相比传统静态工具PHQ-9更具互动性和适应性。研究表明用户对其信任度更高，且整体评分良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁症筛查工具PHQ-9缺乏互动性和适应性，无法满足用户需求。

Method: 开发了HopeBot，结合检索增强生成和实时澄清功能，并在英国和中国的132名成年人中进行了对比研究。

Result: HopeBot与PHQ-9评分一致性高（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 基于语音的LLM聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

*Kushal Gajjar,Harshit Sikchi,Arpit Singh Gautam,Marc Hammons,Saurabh Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过轻量级奖励信号生成准确SQL，在Text2SQL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言转SQL（Text-to-SQL）的挑战，尤其是复杂查询的准确性和可执行性。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计，仅依赖执行正确性和格式标签合规性。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中超越现有监督和指令调优基线模型，仅使用7B参数模型和少量计算资源。

Conclusion: RL方法在Text-to-SQL任务中具有高效性和可扩展性，同时发布了两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI方法难以为非专家用户生成清晰、可解释的输出，因此需要一种更直观的解释方法。

Method: 提出Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS)，结合局部和全局特征重要性选择示例。

Result: 在用户研究中，FGNS显著提升了非专家识别模型错误的能力，同时保持了与正确预测的一致性，且决策更快更准确。

Conclusion: FGNS是迈向更符合人类理解的模型评估的一步，但需进一步缩小解释质量与用户信任之间的差距。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Motivation: Lockean信念集在经典逻辑演绎下通常不封闭，这限制了其在信念变化理论中的应用。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种信念集闭包特性的表征，并设计了一种概率更新方法以实现最小修订。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修订实现信念集的演绎闭包。

Conclusion: 论文为Lockean信念集的逻辑闭包和修订提供了理论支持和方法工具。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

TL;DR: FEVO框架通过多阶段增强（CPT、SFT、RL）提升LLM在金融领域的性能，验证了金融知识扩展和结构化推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在金融领域应用LLM的进展有限，需结合领域知识提升性能。

Method: FEVO框架分三阶段：CPT扩展金融知识，SFT训练结构化推理，RL整合知识。使用高质量数据集FEVO-Train。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中表现最佳，优于更大模型和专家模型。

Conclusion: FEVO框架显著提升LLM在金融领域的性能，验证了多阶段增强的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设施的能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低下且成本高，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 结合LSTM进行时间序列预测，遗传算法优化参数，SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: LSTM在预测复杂需求时表现最佳（MAE: 21.69, RMSE: 29.96），优于Prophet和ARIMA。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗能源管理提供了高效、透明且可扩展的解决方案，未来可结合强化学习进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety是一个模块化框架，用于评估AI代理在真实工具环境中的安全性，覆盖八类风险，支持多任务和多用户场景，结合规则分析和LLM评估，揭示主流LLM在51.2%-72.7%的任务中存在不安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理安全性评估多依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，无法全面反映真实风险，需开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出OpenAgentSafety框架，支持真实工具交互（如浏览器、代码执行环境等），覆盖350多项任务，结合规则和LLM评估不安全行为。

Result: 实验显示，主流LLM在51.2%（Claude-Sonnet-3.7）至72.7%（o3-mini）的安全敏感任务中表现不安全。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety揭示了AI代理在真实环境中的安全漏洞，强调需加强安全保障措施才能实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 通过配对偏好数据（即使单个数据点较弱）提升语言模型性能，提出delta学习假设，验证其有效性，并在实验中匹配先进模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖高质量监督数据，但这类数据稀缺。研究探索如何利用弱监督数据提升模型性能。

Method: 提出delta学习假设，通过配对弱模型输出生成偏好数据，用于后训练8B模型。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，该方法匹配了先进模型Tulu 3的表现，且成本更低。

Conclusion: delta学习证明弱配对数据也能有效提升模型性能，为后训练提供了更简单经济的方案。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果抽象的方法，用于在缺乏完整因果图的情况下识别因果效应，并构建了可识别性标准的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在观测数据中识别因果效应通常需要完整的因果图，但在复杂或高维场景中，这种图往往未知。因果抽象提供了一种简化表示，保留了部分因果信息。

Method: 通过形式化因果抽象为因果图的集合，研究在这些集合中因果查询的可识别性，并提出了多个可识别性标准。

Result: 构建了可识别性标准的层次结构，阐明了不同因果知识水平下的可识别性关系。

Conclusion: 该框架为在缺乏完整因果知识时推理可识别性提供了工具，并通过文献案例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评分规则虽然能保证概率预测的准确性（即“properness”），但未必与人类对文本的偏好一致。本文旨在设计一种既能保持properness又能与人类偏好对齐的评分规则。

Method: 设计了Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR)，通过最小化proper评分规则与参考分数（如人类评分）之间的均方误差，优化评分规则。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持properness的同时，比现有方法更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR成功解决了文本信息激发中评分规则与人类偏好的对齐问题，为语言模型的应用提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

Abstract: Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with
imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and
hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the
development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating
large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While
these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful
evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the
pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current
capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot
manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by
extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and
real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to
rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical
confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized
trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world
experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more
successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,
using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,
performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.

Motivation: 解决海洋机器人中的立体声学数据融合问题，利用声学几何实现跨模态声纳的特征投影。

Conclusion: 该方法为海洋机器人应用中的立体声纳数据融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and
propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar
to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a
forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and
forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras,
and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature
in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally,
we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative
pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we
identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics
like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

TL;DR: CRED是一种用于主动偏好学习（APL）的轨迹生成方法，通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择，提升奖励估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需适应人类偏好（如距离、时间、安全性），但现有APL方法在长时任务中难以探索完整轨迹空间或生成有效查询。

Method: CRED通过环境设计“想象”新场景，并利用反事实推理生成多样且信息丰富的轨迹用于排序。

Result: 在GridWorld和OpenStreetMap导航实验中，CRED提升了奖励学习效果并具备跨环境泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRED通过创新设计显著改进了APL的轨迹生成和奖励学习效率。

Abstract: For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human
preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing.
Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting
trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore
the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries,
particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation
method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing
environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios
through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling
rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true
preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for
ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap
data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across
different environments.

Result: 实验使用Franka Research 3机器人，结合DIGIT触觉传感器和RGBD摄像头，成功探索了静态物体的形状和属性，并通过不确定性量化规划探索动作以恢复精确的3D结构。

Conclusion: GPDF方法通过多模态融合实现了复杂物体几何的主动探索与建模，并展示了超越几何属性的潜力。

Abstract: Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and
semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in
unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through
interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and
tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)
representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily
focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling
surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using
point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,
which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By
utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need
extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by
aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework
iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using
differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.
By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to
maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the
real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot
manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile
sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In
these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects
assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we
investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian
Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and
mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With
PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control
them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming

Conclusion: Auto-RubikAI为智能制造、机器人教育和自主执行提供了高效、模块化的任务规划基础。

Abstract: This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework
that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM),
and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks
exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based
on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and
large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step
task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The
proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,
overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to
construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates
structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module
architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy
Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic
arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.
Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized
configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our
KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining
interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular
foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics
education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware

Method: 结合粗粒度3D重建、对比学习的实例分割和文本引导的实例细化。

Result: 实验表明，DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何形状，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp在复杂环境中表现出色，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein
Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution
for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics
approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model
able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction
with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics
model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid
and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate
Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one
involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against
a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario
involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR).
Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable
to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems.
Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain
stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive
rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a
component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released
under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are
available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further
research.

Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，利用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，平均定位精度分别为0.026m（城镇道路）、0.029m（林荫道）和0.081m（交通密集高速路），显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中提供了可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Result: 实验验证了控制器的稳定性，为从远程操作到自主手术的过渡提供了关键见解。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RCM机械臂控制稳定性的空白，为未来自主手术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized
Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation
within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the
patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous
subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic
surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.
However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading
errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.
Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view
joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are
irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized
the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing
a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion
of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this
controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We
rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify
our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps
required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation
learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion
models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task
generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency.
While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in
legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding
errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited
data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in
legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address
these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework
for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO
finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions.
Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using
diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then,
it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task
transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion
Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized
deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient
solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained
robotic platforms.

Conclusion: hPGA-DP通过几何归纳偏置和混合架构设计，显著提升了扩散策略的效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to
their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these
policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,
conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a
robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations
and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to
ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating
geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this
redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical
framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric
inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it
provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric
primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks
to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable
operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that
incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging
its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts
a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action
decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising
process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task
performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but
also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model
compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

Conclusion: DRO-EDL-MPC框架有效平衡了自动驾驶中的安全性和效率，适用于动态感知不确定性场景。

Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making
control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety
risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both
aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning
(EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on
evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness
according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware
constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC
algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications.
Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains
efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative
constraints under low confidence.

Abstract: High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data.
However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the
attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in
post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even
online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the
tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at
a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost
timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components
and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization
and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system
are demonstrated.

Abstract: Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages
in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating
consecutive sharp corners for autonomous racing.However, this can be a
challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions
between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking.
Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to
derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often
compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and
unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth
transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift
phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy
that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation
results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route

Motivation: 抓取姿态检测（GPD）依赖大数据集，但数据隐私和集中化问题突出。联邦学习（FL）虽能保护隐私，但大模型的通信开销对资源受限的机器人不适用。

Method: 分析GPD模型各模块的学习动态，识别收敛慢的模块，并在两阶段训练中优先优化这些模块以减少通信开销。

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集和真实机器人实验中，该方法优于FedAvg等基线，通信效率更高且抓取成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能之间取得了更好的平衡，为去中心化训练GPD模型提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Conclusion: FineGrasp在语义抓取中表现出高效性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic grasping have led to its integration as a core
module in many manipulation systems. For instance, language-driven semantic
segmentation enables the grasping of any designated object or object part.
However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for
small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline
to fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel grasping method, FineGrasp,
which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce
multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate
regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined
graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated
grasp dataset and show that mixed sim-to-real training further improves grasp
performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in
grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic
grasping.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的机器人-超声引导中心静脉导管插入（CVC）流程，结合深度学习和机器人运动规划，实现了高精度的血管定位和针插入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVC手术的成功率受限于解剖变异和操作者依赖性，错误可能导致严重并发症，因此需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用深度学习模型从深度图像识别解剖标志，机器人规划扫描、分割、重建和定位血管，并在超声引导下完成针插入。

Conclusion: 这是首个在高仿真模型上验证的机器人CVC系统，展示了临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure
for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its
success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided
visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further
complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle
placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems
offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In
this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,
from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a
deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a
depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously
define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework
is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and
arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.
Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance
with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity
commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The
proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the
first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15
\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less
than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first
robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated
planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for
clinical translation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时估计语音工作负荷的算法，旨在通过调整系统需求避免不良工作负荷状态，提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务环境中高低工作负荷交替会影响表现，需实时估计工作负荷以调整系统交互方式。

Method: 开发了一种实时估计语音工作负荷的算法，并分析其准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 算法能准确估计语音工作负荷，适用于不同个体和人机协作模式。

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task.
Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through
pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while
capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured
environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot
arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but
typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces
necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing
adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging
for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse
kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control.
Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue
from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average
of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of
exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging
contamination from surfaces.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多机器人时间关键搜索任务中表现优异，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas
needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every
location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this
domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize
inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also
minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must
directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional
attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for
coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach
uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing
attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a
multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated
experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by
16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to
non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world
platforms using quad-copters.

Result: 算法在Intel Xeon Gold 6226R处理器上测试，误差中位数3.5%，运行时间中位数0.21ms。在400个6秒自动驾驶日志片段中验证了准确性和延迟。

Conclusion: 该算法高效、准确，适用于动态物体碰撞概率估计，尤其在考虑时间依赖性时表现优异。

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities
between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are
given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an
adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple
algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Abstract: Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for
extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in
standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a
simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and
accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile
perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise
management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack &
tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring
by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work,
we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching,
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from
Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal
demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness,
achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables
the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating
reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through
extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness
in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at
